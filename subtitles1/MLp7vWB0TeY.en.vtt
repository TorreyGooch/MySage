00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:02.579
When I started working on this problem

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.629
Or, I guess, when when it started working on me

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.178
Was probably really in the mid 80's and I found myself

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.770
Suffering from two things one was a very lengthy sequence of nightmares about Nuclear destruction

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.299
and they're very affecting dreams and

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.989
associated with that was a sense of amazement that a

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.179
dream that was that awful could reflect a reality that could be that awful

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:41.969
and an additional

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.340
amazement out the fact that, despite

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.910
the production of thousands and tens and thousands of weapons of unimaginable destruction

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.759
and that qualitative qualitative change in human capacity that represented

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.480
That people could go about their day-to-day lives without

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.499
acting as if anything fundamental whatsoever had changed

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.299
Now I've never really been able to figure out why that disturbed me so much

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.210
when it seemed to not disturb

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.080
to any

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.080
profound degree most of the people I knew

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.020
It doesn't really matter

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.769
The upshot of it was that I spent...

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.949
I probably spent my whole life trying to understand what evil was and, more importantly, what might be done about it

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.180
it's a strange pursuit in some ways for an academic done undertake because

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.680
Academics tend to talk about academic things. And one thing you can say about evil is that, whatever it is, it's not bloody well academic

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.900
It's not an intellectual issue. It's an existential issue and

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.959
it's it's not a theoretical issue. It's an it's an issue that deals with that

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.020
absolute nature of reality and

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.739
I guess sometimes I think that people who go into Academia

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.000
Go into Academia to shield themselves from having to ask questions about the absolute nature of reality

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.880
so

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.659
Anyways, I think before you can talk about something

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.020
Before you can dare to talk about something like evil

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.220
You should do some thinking about what it is that you're talking about

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.460
Definitionally speaking. I learned this I believe from

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.630
a historian named Jeffrey Burton Russell

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.840
Who wrote a very detailed history of the idea of the Devil in the 1980s when,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.440
such histories were strange, to say the least, he was very interested

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.620
in the history of the embodiment of ideas of evil and

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.620
One of the things his work did for me was to help me

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.860
clarify the distinction between two terrible things

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.320
The distinction that has to be made and that's the distinction between tragedy and evil

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.080
and I don't think you can talk about it evil at all until you distinguish it from tragedy and

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.900
so I'm going to try to distinguish evil from tragedy by making some reference to the essential existential condition of human beings

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.300
I would say that the nature of the human being is such that it consists of

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.300
a confrontation with the bounded finite with the unbounded infinite,

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.910
and that those are the bare facts of the matter and the facts are that

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.960
The world of experience as it presents

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.420
itself to us

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.980
is literally and not metaphorically

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.520
complex beyond our capacity to understand

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.800
and that means  that people deal in a real sense on an ongoing

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:38.640
basis with the infinite and I believe that that fact is the reason why religious experience is essentially...

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.640
And belief is essentially endemic to mankind, it's a human universal

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.840
and it's not because people believe, it's because

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.600
human existence as such consists of a confrontation between the finite and the infinite

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.120
and religious systems merely take that into account

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.640
Now our finitude in the face of the infinite has some inevitable consequences

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.200
and I would say those consequences

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.440
are essentially the existential conditions of life. The first of those consequences is that

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.240
the finite is always overwhelmed by the infinite, it has to be because it can't encapsulate it and so what that means is that it's

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.520
that suffering is central to the nature of human existence

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.080
and suffering exists as a consequence of the consequences of our limitations

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.600
I mean every single person who's alive is going to die

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.880
And every single person who's alive is going to deal with serious physical illness and mental distress

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.660
If they don't suffer, if they aren't suffering it directly, immediately, right now on their own

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.460
It's almost inevitably the case that every single person who walks the Earth

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.240
is confronting the bare bones of reality at that level in the guise of an afflicted family member

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.400
And so the fact of our finitude is again, no academic issue.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.740
It's essential to the nature of our being and we're forced to deal with it on an ongoing basis

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.960
So I would say insufficiency is built into human experience and there are existential consequences to that

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.600
Now I read something a long time ago, and I don't remember who wrote it, but it was written about

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.780
Jewish commentary on the Torah

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.700
God is omniscient

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.000
omnipotent and omnipresent

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.480
What does he lack?

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.440
And the answer is limitation

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.560
And that's a riddle and an answer of unparalleled brilliance

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.700
as far as I'm concerned, because I think it speaks

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.760
Deeply to something about the central nature of existence itself and that is that

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.550
without limitation, there's no being

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.070
Now that's a hard thing to understand

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.820
But I think you can understand it in a number of different ways

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.040
the first thing you might want to understand is that...

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.100
I play this game with my students sometimes in my class

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.860
I'll come up to a student, I pick a poor victim at random and come up to them

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and say: Okay, we're going to play a game

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.160
And they say: ok. And I say: well you move first

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:06.090
well, they don't know what to do and the reason for that is because the limiting parameters of the game have not been defined

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.500
And, as a consequence of that, they're stunned by their infinite freedom into complete immobility

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.350
and what that means in a sense is that in the absence of serious constraint there can be no choice

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.780
no freedom, no existence. And I believe this to be

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.760
fundamentally true, just as the fact that human being is vulnerable is fundamentally true

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.820
Here's another example that I think is more personal to me

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.540
and it emerged in my imagination as a consequence of my contemplation of my son's

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.420
vulnerability. So I have children. They´re teenagers now. I still like them

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:46.298
One of the things I was really struck by when my children were little was how perfect

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:49.089
they were like and I believe that that was the

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.469
Benevolence of God in a sense -  children are tremendously difficult

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:59.160
they're a tremendous responsibility - but they're so perfect and they manifest that perfection in such a

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:06.320
remarkable way that that's the payment for taking on the responsibility of bringing them into being and caring for them and

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.500
The thing about being a parent is that the vulnerability of people

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.000
may manifest to you in a way that was never the case prior to that and

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:22.058
It's not it's haunting and it's beautiful, but it's also exactly right in a way, and I was thinking well look at my son

00:07:22.059 --> 00:07:22.659
He's a little kid

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.360
You know you got to chase after him all the time you can get sick people hurt him

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.920
you know, people are going to be mean to him. He's going to be disappointed in his life

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:36.380
He's vulnerable, and it's a constant tragic reality that he's vulnerable. And I thought well, okay

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:41.678
Let's say we want to do something about that, so let's say we make him so that no one can pick on him

00:07:41.679 --> 00:07:44.828
so it could inflate him to about 20 feet high and equip him with a

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:46.550
metallic

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.639
skeleton and a cast-iron exoskeleton, and you could equip him with a

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:58.299
computerized intelligence that far supersedes his own, and you could remove his vulnerabilities one by one hypothetically

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.539
and of course more and more

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:03.818
We're in a position where we could do that in reality. And one of the things I realized right away was that

00:08:04.369 --> 00:08:07.448
as you remove the vulnerabilities you remove the thing you love

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.880
And then I started to understand more deeply that vulnerability was a precondition for human being and that was a desirable

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.820
precondition because the things about human existence that are wonderful and

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.600
remarkable are so integrally tied up with

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.420
vulnerability that they're actually inextricable

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.460
The Jewish commentary

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:31.159
what the

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
Infinite lacks is the finite

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.540
There's a more abstract way of getting at the same thing

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.500
If you could do absolutely anything you wanted at any point

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.840
and be anywhere you wanted, be anything you wanted and if there was nothing that was out of your reach

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:51.260
there would be nothing to do because you'd be everything at once and when you're everything at once,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.440
which is at least in principle the position of God,

00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:00.609
There's no story and there's no being and there's something about being that is a story. And without limitation

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:07.899
there's no story. So then the question starts to become, with regards to consideration of human vulnerability. Is there a way to conduct your life

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.939
In such a manner that the intrinsic vulnerability that characterizes your life

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:20.679
is rendered, not only acceptable but desirable. And to me that's the central question of existence. And I tell you, get that wrong

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.899
and you're on the wrong track and if you're on the wrong track, man, you are in one terrible place

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.800
I would say, with regards to tragedy, humans are vulnerable and that's tragic

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.800
But if tragedy is the price that we pay for existence then so be it if existence is justifiable

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.499
And so tragedy itself, which is merely a revelation of our vulnerability, can't be regarded as evil

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.260
it's just a... it's a condition of existence

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:54.580
And so it's necessary to distinguish the tragic conditions of existence from evil before you can even address the problem

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.100
And I think what that means to some degree is you should not blame on the

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.140
relationship between the finite and the infinite

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:07.180
the terrible failings of humanity that can be laid directly at the feet of human beings

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.860
So earthquakes aren't evil and cancer isn't evil and

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:16.800
Mental illness isn't evil and predators aren't evil. They just are part of the way things are

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.280
But there are certain categories of human action that are

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.600
definitely outside the parameters of mere tragedy. And those are the things we really have to get a handle on

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:34.900
Evil for me is differentiated from tragedy by its lack of necessity and it's volunteerism

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:36.140
and

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.560
It's a tenant, I think, of modern materialistic thought that

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.420
there are social or material causes for actions and it's an extraordinarily useful theory

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.260
And I think... but I think one of the unfortunate consequences of that

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.480
is that we've tended to write off much of human misbehavior and attribute it to, say

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.400
insufficiencies and material conditions

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:04.150
which is not an it's not an acceptable theory. There are all sorts of human cultures that were characterized by

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.360
virtually complete absence of material

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.440
Luxury, well-being

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.720
Whose cultures were highly functional and and highly moral

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.970
And to describe the propensity towards misbehavior as a consequence of economic inequality

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.790
Is entirely beside the point as far as I'm concerned

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.350
Evil is more pernicious than that

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.470
Which is generated for example by social inequality. I think it's actually, although

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:37.239
this is a terrifying thought in some ways, it's more appropriate to consider it a form of

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.930
demonically

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.530
warped

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.600
aesthetic. And I'll give you a couple of examples of what I mean by that for example

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:53.080
Because the manifestation of this warped aesthetic makes itself

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.989
apparent under certain conditions, so for example

00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:01.780
I think it made itself apparent in the imagination of the first politician who coined the acronym

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.810
MAD or Mutual Assured Destruction

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.910
That's an aesthetic of Evil, to make a joke

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.729
of a situation that catastrophic

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:19.540
indicates the kind of malevolence that lurks behind the fact that such a condition exists

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.580
The motto on the gates of Auschwitz, I believe,

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.290
in the second world war

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.480
Work will make you free

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:33.040
That's another manifestation of the aesthetic of evil. It's a terrible terrible

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.980
ironic joke and

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:41.260
It's instructive to meditate on what sort of imagination would have the arrogance to

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.980
tell such a terrible joke

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.899
The concentration Camps are classic examples of evil

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.309
And I think by analyzing at least certain kinds of events that occurred within them

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:58.960
It's easier to get a clear idea of what evil constitutes. And one of the stories that's always

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:03.100
haunting me, I guess, is - I believe it's another story derived from Auschwitz -

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:09.579
The prison guards in Auschwitz would take the prisoners who were already stripped of their dignity, and to whatever degree

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:16.560
possible, their identity and their culture and their language and their status as valuable beings. And yet that wasn't sufficient

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:23.140
they needed to be tortured in addition to that before they were killed and the torture often consisted of a

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.960
self-evidently counterproductive work

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:35.079
A situation that also frequently characterized activity in the soviet gulag archipelago where perhaps 60 million people met their death

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:45.040
A typical Auschwitz example was the requirement for prisoners to carry 100-pound sacks of wet salt from one side of the compound and then back again

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.559
Now that's evil as far as I'm concerned

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:53.600
and you have to think about it from an aesthetic perspective in a sense because it's a celebration of horror

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.320
And it's a conscious attempt to violate the conditions that make life itself tolerable, and it's aimed at

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.790
dehumanization

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.790
destruction of the ideal

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.010
And at an even deeper level,

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.100
revenge against the conditions of existence itself

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:18.000
I've tried to understand the developmental pathway that leads to acts like that

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.440
My academic research as well as my clinical experience

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.840
Has revealed to me that

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:34.960
What appears to lie at the bottom of motivation for the excesses of behavior that characterize evil

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.960
are too tightly causally related factors

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.720
one, arrogance and another resentment

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.820
And both of those are tied up with

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:56.340
vulnerability of human beings in the face of the infinite but

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.340
but tied up with something more

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.620
profound as well

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:07.600
The most thorough account of this that I've managed, I think, at least to partially comprehend

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.200
I believe is contained in the first couple of the stories in the old testament

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.300
In Genesis

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:20.820
The story of Adam and Eve and the fall of man. And the immediately following story of Cain and Abel

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:29.140
As far as we can tell those are very very old stories. They predate judaism at least in some of their

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.260
in some of their structural elements

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:37.960
It's conceivable that some of the and those stories are as old as the human capacity to tell stories itself

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.969
Assuming that they were grounded in an oral tradition that predated the written tradition

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:47.800
and we know that oral traditions can last at least in some forms unchanged for periods of up to

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.169
25,000 years, so the anthropological and archaeological evidence is fairly clear on that point

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.530
these are very very very old stories

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.820
And people remember them and created them for reasons we really don't understand

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:05.940
And they're strange and mysterious and unforgettable all at the same time

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:13.020
The story of Adam and Eve, as far as I can tell, is the story of the coming of consciousness

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.900
The coming of self-consciousness to Mankind

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.560
And, I think that the human

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.520
The human self-consciousness is what separates us from animals

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.540
In Genesis there's an insistence that

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:36.519
When Adam ate the apple that eve offered to him the scales fell from his eyes and the first thing that he realized was that

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.580
He was naked

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.509
And what that seems to me to mean is that, I mean...

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.540
I think it means first of all that women make men self-conscious

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:48.279
And I think there's ample reason to presume not and there's good evolutionary reasons for suggesting

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.220
why that might be the case. Because sexual selection among

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:56.829
human beings has been a primary force of evolutionary development and sexual selection in human beings

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:58.910
is primarily

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:03.040
conducted by women. So, for example, as Roy has pointed out in

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.159
his address to the APA a few years ago,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:12.489
and I hope I get this right, twice as many of your relatives where women as men. And that means that women

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.979
are more frequently reproductive successful than men and that they reject most men

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:25.149
And the rejection of a man for reproductive purposes by a woman is the most serious form of rejection that's possible from an evolutionary

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.170
point of view because the judgment is that

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:32.820
Well you might be nice enough to talk to but you're sure not fit to have your genes propagate into the next generation

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.000
So it's no wonder that women can make men self-conscious

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.310
And I think there's some reason to presume that it's the sexual selection forces that women placed upon man

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:47.169
That drove rapid human cortical evolution and the development of self-consciousness. Now that's a leap

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.320
And there's no way I can justify that in the course of this particular

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.280
talk but I think there is good reason to presume that it's the case

00:17:54.900 --> 00:18:01.080
In Genesis human beings become self-conscious and the first thing that happens to them is that they realize they're naked and then the next thing

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.870
that happens to them is they develop the moral sense to tell the difference between good and evil

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:09.250
And it's a very strange thing because in some sense before a creature is self conscious

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:13.900
there is no distinction between good and evil because as I said before a predator is not evil

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:19.060
It's just a predator. The fact of a predator like a wolf might be a tragedy for the rabbit

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.749
But you can't be assuming that the wolf is evil merely because it wants to eat the rabbit

00:18:22.749 --> 00:18:27.280
but with the dawning of self-consciousness there seems to be

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:33.340
the emergence of a moral sense that's essentially unique to human beings and that has something to do with our

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.709
capacity to reflect upon the mechanisms of our action and then, for some reason, to be able to

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.999
modify those actions and to choose which ones to implement into the future, in the future

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.180
We don't understand that and you can even deny if you'd like that the phenomena of free choice exists

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.750
But our culture is essentially

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:56.170
predicated on the notion that it does exist and in the absence of evidence that it doesn't I'm going to take the easy way out

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.070
and assume that it does

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.669
Otherwise things fall apart and they fall apart badly

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.980
When...

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:10.150
After Adam and Eve becomes self conscious the first thing they do is close themselves. And to me that's a mythological

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.320
description of the emergence of culture as an

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.180
intersession between the fundamental

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:22.100
vulnerability and nakedness of the human form and the depredations of nature. If you realize that you're vulnerable

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.820
and prone to death the first thing you're going to do is to start rearranging the manner in which you construe yourself

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.729
So that you can protect yourself from such an unfortunate outcome

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.879
that's, I think, partly why God curses Adam with the

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:39.340
necessity of work once he finds out, once God finds out that people have become self conscious. Like if you know that

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:44.560
that winter is lurking in the future, for example, you're going to work and animals don't work

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.360
they're just motivated to do whatever they do

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.540
But humans work and that means they subvert their day to day

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:56.260
motivations, their immediate motivations for the purposes of future security and there's a real cost to that

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:04.320
I mean, part of the cost is separation from the pure and unadulterated flow of animal life, and I believe that people suffer from that

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.960
absence of flow

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.940
continually and

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.999
the advantage they gain from it

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.940
Is that they can plan for the future, but the disadvantage is that they're calculative and cold and separated from their own instinctual resources

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:28.400
Eve, of course, is cursed by what's going to be terrible pain in childbirth, and that's related to the development of

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:34.709
the Immense skull size that characterizes human infants and their incredibly lengthy period of

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:39.089
dependence which is also associated with their immense brain

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.879
After Adam and eve become self-conscious they hide

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.940
And this is actually a comical part of genesis

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.679
it's never really read as a comedy, but it is a comedy even the fall itself is a comedy and...

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.589
so they're hiding away behind a bush

00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:02.820
and God comes walking through the garden and God, the infinite, is accustomed to walking with Adam, with no

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.200
interruption of the flow of information between them

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.520
But Adam is in error and God says you know

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.820
Where where have you gone and Adam says: Oh well

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:18.870
I'm hiding. And God says, which is kind of stupid really and this is why it's a comics, like he's hiding behind a bush

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.700
This is God, and he can see through bushes and like Adam should know that. But It doesn't really matter

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:29.159
He's hiding me on this bush anyways and God... So Adam says I'm hiding and and God says: Well

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.940
well why are you hiding? Well it's because Adam is ashamed and...

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.509
Adam says: Well, I'm naked

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.630
And this is an example of the tremendous

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:45.389
compression of Human wisdom into a few lines that characterizes mythology. You could say: Well, why would people hide from God

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.359
once they realize they're naked? And I would say well, that's pretty obvious, like, once you know you're vulnerable.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.309
Or do you really have enough courage to manifest any sort of semblance of a divine destiny?

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.159
Well, the answer to that is pretty much, clearly no

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:04.859
And it's no bloody wonder. And so the hiding is... People hide when they're self-conscious and vulnerable. And what are they hiding from then?

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:10.260
They're hiding from their deepest destiny and it's no wonder. God says: Okay, yeah, well you figured that out

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:15.239
and how that happened. And Adam says, and this is comical too, It was the woman's fault. Which I think is really funny and

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:20.340
which actually may have been the original sin and not the eating of the apple, right? The first time that

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:25.470
the man blamed the woman for his self-conscious misery

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.980
I think that's the real fall and not the rise of self-consciousness itself

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.450
Anyways, we know the rest of the story. God says: Oh, well the cats out of the bag now.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:39.509
You know you're vulnerable and from here on in history starts. Your out of paradise, you're out of unconscious

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:45.810
identification with the natural world. You're going to work, you're going to sweat lots of the time it isn't going to work and

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:50.550
Women, they're going to be beholden to their husbands not because that's divine

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.550
fiat, but because the developmental...

00:22:54.310 --> 00:23:01.200
The developmental dependency of a human infant is so extreme that women are cursed to rely on men for protection

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.200
when they're at their most vulnerable

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:09.060
Fine. So that's self-consciousness and an explanation for why people would hide away from their destiny

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.609
But then the next story, the Cain and Abel story really

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.670
elaborates that out and describes it. And so Cain and Abel, of course, are two sons of Adam and Eve

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.660
And they're really the first people

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.810
Because, of course Adam and Eve were made by God

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:27.329
so they're really not people at all because people are born. And Cain and Abel are the first two people

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.300
And they characterized, as far as I can tell,

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:40.760
to canonical patterns of reaction, to the terrible vulnerability that's revealed as a consequence of the development of self-consciousness

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.600
Cain and Abel make sacrifices to God

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.000
Why?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.970
Human cultures make sacrifices. That's what they do, sacrifice, sacrificial rituals is human universal

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.300
blood sacrifices is human universal

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.999
human sacrifice, at least in some

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:03.869
anthropological epochs was regarded as a human universal. Why do people make sacrifices to God to please them?

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.450
It seems like a mystery to modern people

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.760
I ask my students. What sacrifices did you make to go to university?

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.160
Well, they can answer that in

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:17.670
2/10 of a second. You know they can't party as much as they might have they can't drink nearly as much beer as they might

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:22.800
have liked to. More seriously, a lot of them work, a lot of them have put their families in

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.680
serious financial straits to send them to university. They've given up all sorts of things

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:35.339
In order to pursue a course of action that they believe will best ensure their harmonious relationship with the nature of reality?

00:24:35.769 --> 00:24:42.389
Everyone makes sacrifices. Ok, we can say that now because we're psychologically sophisticated and linguistically sophisticated

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.140
We know something about human psychology

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:49.289
But thousands and thousands of years ago, before people had this explicit psychological acumen, the best

00:24:49.289 --> 00:24:55.100
they could do is act out and tell stories about human psychology because they hadn't developed any further than that

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.500
And Cain and Abel is one of those stories

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.470
The Sacrifices are burnt on an altar

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.319
Why? Well a smoke rises. Well,

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.820
so what? Well God's up in the sky and if the smoke rises up there, and he gets a whiff of it

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.389
He can tell what the quality of the sacrifice was and you can laugh about that

00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:15.179
And you can think it. You can think about it as primitive

00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:17.729
But it's not primitive, its artistic and it's beautiful in it

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.949
And it's accurate. And here's why, is because

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:26.240
before the invention of the electrical light and maybe before the invention of fire and...

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:34.080
The closest a human being could ever get to direct confrontation with the absolute unknown was to look up at the night sky

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.400
Because the night sky, especially when it's sprinkled with stars

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.500
confronts you directly with the fact of the infinite. And to make the presupposition

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.600
that God resides in the infinite, and you're having a direct experience

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.800
of the infinite at that moment, is not a primitive notion it's a very

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.820
intelligent and and creative hypothesis

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:58.740
And so, the notion that god occupies the sky, the day sky being equally as impressive as the night sky, is not a primitive

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:06.059
hypothesis, it's a reflection of the nature of a certain kind of human experience. You burn something and you send the smoke up

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.780
God gets a crack at determining the quality

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.680
of your offering, the quality of your sacrifice

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.920
Well, let's be perfectly clear about this

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:20.840
If your sacrifices aren't first-rate the nature of your relationship with the infinite is going to suffer dreadfully

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.080
And that's exactly what the story of Cain and Abel reveals.

00:26:24.639 --> 00:26:25.750
Now, Abel

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:31.769
He's a trusting character. He believes in the nature of experience, in the nature of existence. When he's called on to make a sacrifice

00:26:31.769 --> 00:26:38.849
he sacrifices the best that he has to offer and that makes God happy and as a consequence everything that abel touches turns to gold

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.620
Everyone likes him, they respect him. His crops multiply, he's successful with women

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:50.940
Plus he's a wonderful guy, so you could hardly imagine a more annoying creature if you possibly attempted to do it

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:56.190
Whereas Cain has reacted to his self-consciousness by withdrawing from the infinite

00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:01.440
And there's a tremendous danger in that because it starts to mean that he relies purely on his own

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.020
devious devices to

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.180
Sale his ship through the shores of life

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:14.040
He believes, as his arrogance develops, as a consequence of this withdrawal from the infinite

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:21.240
A contact that he can't tolerate because he can't tolerate his own vulnerability, that he is able to deceive the structure of reality itself to offer

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.020
second-rate sacrifices to God himself, who can see

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:30.059
absolutely everything because the infinite is absolutely everything and to prevail nonetheless

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.150
Well, needless to say this does not work

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:39.689
And it doesn't work in an obvious way if you talk to people and they reveal to you their

00:27:40.059 --> 00:27:44.729
unnecessary suffering it's very straightforward to look behind what it is that they have to say

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.729
They'll tell you the poor decisions they made

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.839
in their lives and the opportunities that they didn't take and the chances that they didn't

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:57.989
they didn't have enough courage to grasp and the sacrifices they fail to make. There's nothing mysterious about it

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:04.349
And their own experiences teach them full well that they pathologized the relationship they have with the nature of reality

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.369
Well, that's a terrible thing. Well, and Cain is dreadfully unhappy

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.489
He's unhappy because nothing he ever wants happens

00:28:11.489 --> 00:28:16.240
And that's partly because he doesn't really want it because if he really wanted he'd make the right sacrifices

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:21.560
And the salt is rubbed into his wounds by the existence of his brother, for whom everything seems simple

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:24.630
But of course really isn't. Cain goes to complain to God

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:30.689
And I had to read three or four different translations of these particular verses to figure out what this meant

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.390
And he says

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:37.380
What in the world is going on here? I'm working myself to the bone

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.410
I'm sacrificing things left right and center. Everything

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:45.929
I touch turns to dirt, everything turns against me. Like, what's up with the nature of reality?

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.660
Cain's essential vulnerability is revealed

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:56.380
And exacerbated by his pathological attitude towards his own actions. God says to him, essentially

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.280
Sin is a predatory cat that

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.720
crouches at your doorway and leaps on you at will

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.360
But if you only wanted to, you could master it.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.400
And that is absolutely

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:13.340
the last thing that Cain wants to hear because if things are going from bad to worse for you

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.690
and you're playing a causal role in it

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.900
There's nothing more horrible that someone can do you

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:25.500
But reveal to you in a way that you can't deny, that you're entirely complicit in your own demise

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:30.180
And that's exactly what God does to Cain. And so, what does Cain do?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.300
Well the logical thing would be listen because if the structure of reality itself tells you something

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:43.680
It's best to listen since there's no way out of it. But that's not what Cain does. He's so incensed by his essential vulnerability,

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:49.520
compromised and exacerbated by his failure to make the appropriate sacrifices and to conduct himself appropriately

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:55.960
that he decides, then and there, number one, to destroy his ideal, to reduce the tension that he feels

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:02.789
when that ideal exists as a contrast point and number two, to destroy the favorite son of God. And so he goes out into the field

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:08.129
and kills Abel. And God comes along and says: Where's my favorite son? And Cain says:

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.500
I killed him

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:17.360
And it's so interesting to me that that story is placed... Really, it's the third story in the old testament

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.290
It's it's with the archaic stories

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:24.740
And it's a story that reveals, as far as I can tell, that there are two essential patterns of reaction to the

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.020
self-conscious vulnerable conditions of existence. And one is

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.180
humble

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.920
approach to infinity with determined attempts to make the appropriate sacrifices

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.020
The other is arrogance, resentment, the keeping of everything good for oneself

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.600
and the degeneration of the soul into something that's homicidally murderous

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.780
Well the story doesn't stop there. It gets really compressed in this part

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:53.670
And that's perhaps because some of its being lost with the passages of time. But the next thing that happens is that

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.760
Well, God doesn't punish Cain

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.320
And you think

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:03.599
That's kind of strange. I mean, in the whole old testament, God, he's punishing people left right and center

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.030
Why not Cain? And you think, well

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.699
He marks Cain, and he says to the people who are around that they should leave him alone

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.959
Because he's been marked by God as to be left alone. And the reason for that I think

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.410
And this is something that's reflected in our legal system, is that

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.920
Murder promotes revenge

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:28.260
And revenge destroys societies. And so God puts an end to the situation, right there and then, by telling people

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.060
that, despite the fact that Cain has

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:37.380
has committed a terrible crime that there will be no retribution

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.140
Cain goes off and gets married and he has a number of generations of offspring

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.860
If you insult a member of the first generation of Cain's offspring

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.720
he doesn't kill you, it kills seven of you

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.940
And if you insult a member of the second generation of Cain's offspring

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:02.839
he doesn't kill seven of you, he kills seven times seven of you

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:10.070
And then on down the road of the offspring of Cain is Tubal Cain

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.780
And Tubal Cain is the

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.989
artificer of weapons of War and

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.920
this

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:24.649
Stunningly Brilliant story says in it's incredibly compressed fashion that the motivation that drives

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:32.449
the commission of the worst human atrocities is an inevitable social consequence of the refusal of the

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:38.329
self-conscious individual to make the sacrifices appropriate to establishing a harmonious life and

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:44.480
their consequent degeneration into a kind of murderous and resentment filled rage

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:52.520
propagating endlessly through its variations in society until everything comes to an end

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.369
And the next story is the flood

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.560
And it's not surprising

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.940
Because if things go from bad to worse long enough

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.620
everything Falls

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:09.109
And it's a terrifying story. I didn't understand that story. I didn't understand that story for years

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.660
It wasn't really until I read Alexandr Solzhenitsyn

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:18.170
that I developed, I think, the cognitive capacity then to even understand what the story meant because

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:21.590
Solzhenitsyn said in its Nobel prize accepting speech

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.720
A single person who stop flying can bring down a tyranny, which is a stunning thing to say

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:31.459
But I would also say something that's been amply demonstrated in the 20th century because we have

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:38.059
historical examples of people who did precisely that. Gandhi did it, Václav Havel did it, Nelson Mandela did it

00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:43.999
Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago was definitely one of the ax blows that brought down the Soviet Union

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.400
A stunning achievement for a person who started writing that book by

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.960
memorizing it when he was a concentration camp victim, this far away from starvation

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:52.940
It shows you,

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:59.520
as clearly as anything possibly can, how powerful the human spirit can be if it's willing to take on the

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:07.540
obligation of its relationship with the divine. And also how terrible things can become if the responsibility of that burden is not shouldered

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.300
Now, it's no wonder as far as I can tell that people don't think this way because

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:14.539
Thinking this way is it's catastrophic in a way

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:19.848
Because the burden it places on the individual is so extreme that it's almost unbearable while in a...

00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:27.019
But that's exactly why it is in Genesis, to begin with, that Adam hides, but he becomes conscious of his own vulnerability

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.770
It's like, he thinks well a creature such as I, I could never bear such a burden well

00:34:30.839 --> 00:34:33.169
there's a lot more to people than meets the eye

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:37.459
And the only way I learned that was by looking at people's and my own. People's and my own

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.949
capacity for Evil, because I started to realize that

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:47.089
we regard ourselves as narrow little beings in a particular kind of box and there's real comfort in that although there's tremendous limitation

00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:52.009
You cannot see your way out of that box until you know. Well what I teach my students

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.629
I teach them about Nazi Germany

00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:58.879
and I try to make them understand that there's an overwhelming probability if they were in Nazi Germany in the

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:02.839
1930s that they would have been perpetrators and nazis. An overwhelming probability

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:08.089
And if they can't accept that, because it's a historical fact, they have absolutely no idea who they are

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.669
Now, imagining yourself as a nazi perpetrator is an unbearably terrifying thing to do

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.500
But I don't believe that you can do...

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.550
I don't think that you have any insight whatsoever into your capacity for good

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:24.300
until you have some well-developed insight into your capacity for evil

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.760
Because people can tell you till they're blue in their face about your capacity for good, it just sounds like...

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.830
It sounds like wishful thinking. It sounds like the sort of thing that an advertiser might tell you on TV

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.830
It's just too good to be true

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:38.070
And I don't think people believe it

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:43.530
But I think that if you tell people that, you know, in the cold dark corners of their mind there are

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.949
motivations that are so terrible that they would, they would traumatize

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:53.160
themselves if they were ever revealed, that everyone knows at some level of analysis that that's absolutely true

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:58.920
You think... There's evidence throughout history that it's possible for people to be

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.100
enlightened. And you'd think,

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:08.130
since enlightenment is viewed as the medication for vulnerability and death that everybody would be struggling

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:13.060
as hard as they possibly could to be enlightened, if such a state exactly and precisely

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:20.100
exists, but if the barrier to enlightenment is the development of self consciousness of the individual

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.660
human's infinite capacity for evil then you can be

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.180
immediately

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.280
convinced about why

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.860
Enlightenment is in such short supply

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.100
When I

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:38.120
finished my first provisional examination of the sorts of motivations that drove people to set up concentration camps

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:43.890
and to torture people terribly in those camps, I came to a terrible conclusion

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.800
It was a conclusion that

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:52.060
I think in some ways was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, maybe intellectually and morally, I thought

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.780
I came to understand

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.180
why it is that people depended on their group identity in their cultural identification,

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.180
because that helped protect themselves from their own vulnerability

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:05.680
You have to believe things because you just don't know everything so you have to believe things they fill in the gaps

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.820
the beliefs fill in the gaps

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.449
If the beliefs are stripped from you then your

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.770
defenses against the infinite are stripped. And it's no wonder that people will defend their beliefs

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:22.289
I thought, well you do if you're too involved in defending your beliefs, you're going to be willing to kill other people in their defence

00:37:22.289 --> 00:37:28.580
And we're so technologically powerful now that we can no longer be willing to kill other people in the defense of our own beliefs because

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.440
the time for that is passed

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:35.430
And I realized well with you if you don't stand up for your beliefs you leave yourself bereft

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.600
You're open to the depredations of the infinite. That's equally

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.420
intolerable, it seems to leave no way out

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.820
There is a way out, you know, and I think it's the way out that

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:54.899
genuinely religious people have tried to offer humanity for thousands and thousands of years. And the way out of the conundrum

00:37:55.620 --> 00:38:03.060
posed to you by your reliance on ideological beliefs and your vulnerability in the face of the unknown, is the development of

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.320
a truly integrated and powerful character. And that's a

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.600
individual development and it means

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:17.800
constant confrontation with things you don't understand and constant attempts to ensure that your character is composed of truth and

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.880
solidity Rather than deceit

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:27.020
And to make of yourself something that's built on a rock and not predicated on sand. And the thing is, it's one thing to tell people that

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.300
because maybe they should take care of themselves

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.920
But I don't know if that's enough to tell people because they don't take care of themselves that well

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:39.700
But it's a completely other thing to say look, you know, every time you make a pathological moral decision

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.640
you move the one the world one step closer to complete annihilation

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:48.920
And I absolutely believe that. I think the historical evidence is crystal clear

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:55.800
And I also think that every time you make an appropriate moral decision, and you manifest moral courage in the face of your own vulnerability

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.860
then you move the world one step farther from the break

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:06.980
And every...  that's the case for every single person. You know, Solzhenitsyn said, drawing on his eastern orthodox christian background:

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.940
Every single person is the center of the world

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:16.620
As center of the world, not 'the' center of the world. The world is a complicated place. It can have all sorts of centers

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.220
It's hard to believe that you might be one of them, but

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.900
everything about human existence is hard to believe

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.000
The fact that it's here at all is hard to believe, the nature of it's hard to believe

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.280
Everything that human beings does is so

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:35.760
ridiculous and remarkable that it's like it's a consistently and constantly unfolding miracle. The idea that each of you might be

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.220
a center of the cosmos, in that

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:46.560
infinite admixture of ridiculousness and absurdities, is hardly more than one more ridiculous thing to swallow

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.100
Well I'll summarize, I guess

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.580
I said that tragedy is a precondition for being

00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:01.200
Being is the interplay between the finite and the infinite. And in that interplay there's tragedy. And there's no way out of that

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.500
Evil is something different

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:11.669
Evil is the conscious attempt to make the conditions of existence more pathological than they have to be. And it's motivated by conscious intent

00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:17.669
The motivations arise because people pay a terrible price for their self conscious awareness

00:40:17.669 --> 00:40:23.480
And that awareness is their awareness of their vulnerability. And that is a terrible thing to be aware of

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:35.180
That vulnerability can be confronted forthrightly, accepted, and the appropriate decisions made. Alternatively people can retreat into their own

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:44.240
rationalistic arrogance and attempt to deceive themselves and everyone else about the nature of their own existence and about the nature of reality

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.740
That Pathway leads to nothing but destruction

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.940
I think that there's good reason to assume that it's too late in the...

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.560
in our developmental course as a species for that path to be acceptable anymore

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.880
because we're too powerful, and if too many people stay on that path, we're going to do ourselves in

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:11.180
So I would say as we've become more technologically powerful, an increasing moral burden is being placed on each of us

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:18.740
It matters, to the destiny of the cosmos, whether or not you get your moral act straight

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.820
And I don't mean that in a trivial way

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.540
I believe that that's as close to an empirical fact as anything that can be demonstrated

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:31.300
And I also believe that's as terrifying a thing to consider as anything you could possibly imagine. And maybe it's too much to ask of people

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.960
But you know our great religious traditions do

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:40.920
continually remind us that inside every human being there's a spark of divinity. And that idea is a precondition

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.160
for our entire system of law

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.680
There's always the possibility that it's true

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:52.649
And if it's true it means that there is an infinite avenue of

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:57.240
potential that lays open to every single person. And that the ability

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.579
to transform the terrible conditions of reality into something, not only acceptable

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.980
but worthy of celebration, actually lies within our grasp

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:13.920
An alternative to that, the alternative to that is the continual generation of a kind of hell. That's so

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.300
incomprehensibly awful that,

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.540
by any reasonable person standards,

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.580
it has to be regarded as something to avoid

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.500
That's all I have to say about that.
