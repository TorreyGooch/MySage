00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
obviously but just as obviously it's an

obviously but just as obviously it's an

and<00:09:50.240><c> how</c><00:09:50.560><c> do</c><00:09:50.720><c> you</c><00:09:50.880><c> solve</c><00:09:51.120><c> that</c>

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
and how do you solve that
 

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.389 align:start position:0%
and how do you solve that
and<00:09:52.800><c> the</c><00:09:52.959><c> answer</c><00:09:53.279><c> again</c><00:09:53.600><c> is</c><00:09:53.760><c> well</c><00:09:54.000><c> you</c><00:09:54.160><c> don't</c>

00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
and the answer again is well you don't
 

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:56.230 align:start position:0%
and the answer again is well you don't
know<00:09:54.959><c> if</c><00:09:55.040><c> you</c><00:09:55.200><c> were</c><00:09:55.360><c> in</c><00:09:55.440><c> that</c><00:09:55.600><c> situation</c><00:09:56.160><c> i</c>

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
know if you were in that situation i
 

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.590 align:start position:0%
know if you were in that situation i
don't<00:09:56.320><c> know</c><00:09:56.480><c> what</c><00:09:56.640><c> you</c><00:09:56.800><c> would</c><00:09:56.880><c> decide</c><00:09:57.200><c> or</c><00:09:57.360><c> how</c>

00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
you decided but i do know that you don't
 

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.590 align:start position:0%
you decided but i do know that you don't

dog<00:30:55.440><c> wants</c><00:30:55.760><c> to</c><00:30:55.840><c> play</c><00:30:56.240><c> and</c><00:30:56.799><c> you</c><00:30:56.880><c> know</c><00:30:57.360><c> and</c><00:30:57.440><c> the</c>

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
dog wants to play and you know and the
 

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.950 align:start position:0%
dog wants to play and you know and the

00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
reason you know that is because you want
 

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.950 align:start position:0%
reason you know that is because you want

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
to play too and so you don't have to
 

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.430 align:start position:0%
to play too and so you don't have to
talk<00:31:01.200><c> to</c><00:31:01.360><c> the</c><00:31:01.440><c> dog</c><00:31:01.760><c> to</c><00:31:02.000><c> establish</c><00:31:02.559><c> that</c><00:31:03.200><c> it's</c>

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's there to begin with
 

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.590 align:start position:0%
it's there to begin with
and<00:31:05.279><c> so</c><00:31:05.440><c> we</c><00:31:05.600><c> have</c><00:31:05.840><c> this</c><00:31:06.080><c> biological</c><00:31:06.960><c> substrate</c>

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
