00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
should not rely on them for Faith well

should not rely on them for Faith well
that's<00:00:40.620><c> the</c><00:00:40.800><c> difference</c><00:00:40.920><c> between</c><00:00:41.340><c> faith</c><00:00:41.820><c> and</c>

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between faith and

that's the difference between faith and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
that's good that's right yes but even if
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.889 align:start position:0%
that's good that's right yes but even if
