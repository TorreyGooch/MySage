00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.460
so I hope we can... my plan is to finish this today

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:23.660
and then we'll go into the more concrete details now that you've got some sense of the way that a narrative like this can unfold

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:31.540
if you remember, we were just leaving this terrible little bar, which I think was called the Red Lobster

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.880
something like that; where the fox and the cat had met the coachman

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.460
and the Coachman is obviously someone who takes you somewhere, he takes you on a trip

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.420
and the coachman basically revealed himself, first he kinda looks like a, I guess a somewhat jolly old man

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.100
although his expression doesn't precisely read as jolly

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.140
and then he reveals himself as something positively satanic

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.880
and that's enough to terrify these two-bit thugs, the Fox and the Cat

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.300
who think they're tough, but really aren't tough at all

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.640
and so they see at some point what they're really tangled up in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.160
and I think I mentioned to you that that was something akin... Jung had this idea that people's shadows reach all the way down to hell

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.580
which is actually a very frightening concept, and what he meant by that is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.300
if you take a look at the impulses that drive you that are actually malevolent, if you can admit to such impulses

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.700
that if you basically follow those all the way down to their origin, you can find some very nasty things

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.240
and what you find down there basically is what allies you with people who've done terrible things

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.540
and that's not a very pleasant experience, I would say

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:57.180
although one thing that's worth thinking about is that it is something that can protect you against being very very badly hurt

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.420
because one of the things that characterizes people who develop post-traumatic stress disorder

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.640
is that they're often naive, and then they encounter something that's really not within their framework of thinking

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.960
and it's usually something bad, and because there isn't anything in their philosophy, their way of looking at the world

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.560
that has prepared them for that, they end up fragmented and devastated

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.560
it's actually protective to you if you can figure out what your full range of capabilities is

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.920
because that can help you understand other people a lot better, and to be wiser and more careful in your actions

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.120
it's also useful, I think, if you want to convince yourself to act properly

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:51.140
because if you regard yourself as harmless, which is a big mistake, then nothing you can do is really that bad

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.200
right? because you're harmless, after all; but if you understand that you're seriously not harmless

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.380
then that can make you a lot more careful with yourself

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.000
and I would say that's especially true maybe when you're dealing... when you have kids, and you start dealing with your kids

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.160
if you know that... what you're capable of, because you're human

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.600
then that can motivate you to be much more careful with what you say and do

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.060
and I don't mean cautious, I don't mean timid, I don't mean any of that

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.540
I just mean that you wanna keep things pristine between you and your children, let's say

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.060
because that way they're on your good side, and you want them on your good side

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.840
because children who get on their parents' bad side suffer very badly for it, and sometimes it's because they're literally abused

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.200
but more often it's because they get, well they get abused, let's say, or neglected, in  much more subtle ways

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.520
and you're definitely capable of that, I mean, all you have to do is think about the way you've interacted

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.120
with someone that you've decided to not like, or maybe someone you genuinely don't like

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.720
and that can range from just not paying any attention to them, especially if they're doing something good

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.340
to really pursuing them, and making their life miserable, and you can certainly do that with your family members

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.160
and you can do that with your intimate partners, and you can do that with your friends, and you can do it with yourself

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.000
so it's really worth knowing that, so... well...

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.220
the Fox thinks he's a royal rule breaker, but he's really just a two-bit thug, and this is where he learns that

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.520
so... sorry, I have a new phone, and I'm kind of stupid with it, still

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.200
so...

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.100
well, hypothetically that would work, probably won't

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.940
anyways, the Coachman's got these guys in his grasp now, regardless

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.680
partly because they're already down this road, and they can't back off, and partly 'cause he also offers them more money than they've seen before

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.180
so as bad as they are, they're going to get worse... many of you, I presume, have seen Breaking Bad

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:08.180
that's a really good example of the incorporation, at least in part, or maybe the possession by the shadow from a Jungian perspective

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.440
right, because you have this ordinary high school teacher who really thinks that he's an axe [?] and his family as well

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.380
you know, like your typical persona, roughly speaking, he's just a normal guy

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.940
but part of the reason that he's a normal guy is 'cause he actually hasn't been put in abnormal circumstances

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.760
and then all of a sudden he is, and he has a genuine moral conundrum, right, he's gonna die of lung cancer

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.000
and he has a son who's got a lot of health problems

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.140
and he's terrified that he's going to leave his wife and his child behind with nothing

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:48.800
and then of course as the story... and so he decides to do something that... temporarily... that he regards as... that he would normally regard as reprehensible

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.260
and of course he just gets tangled up in that, but then, as the story unfolds, you see that there's... it's more complicated

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.400
because it's not that he was just innocent good guy, and he decided to turn bad, he's also very resentful

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.560
and angry, and it's partly because he's a bit of a pushover at the beginning, or maybe more than a bit of a pushover

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.080
and also that he didn't really fulfill his own potential, and that, you know

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:18.220
he had friends who walked down the entrepreneurial path and maybe they weren't quite fair to him, but whatever

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.600
he ends up not very successful as a high school teacher, so he's really angry about that, and so

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.880
there's more motivation for him opening up the door to the terrible elements of his personality

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.880
than just the fact that he's got good motivations to do so

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.760
and that unfolds, so you see the warps and twists in his resentful character

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:47.720
increasingly manifest themselves as he walks down this road to, really, total brutality, and it's quite good

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.900
there's a book called "Ordinary Men" that's a lot like that

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.780
I don't think I've mentioned that to you before, but "Ordinary Men" is a book about... it's the best book of its type

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:03.740
maybe it's the only book of its type... it's possible, but it's plotted much like Breaking Bad in some sense

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:09.620
it's a story about these German policemen in the early stages of World War II

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:17.900
and they were guys who were old enough to be raised in Germany really before the Hitlerian propaganda came out in full force

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.200
if you were a teenager, say, in the 1930s, you were gonna be pulled right into the propaganda machine

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.920
and maybe you were part of the Hitler Youth, like you were raised in that, you know

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.920
but if you were older, then you were raised before that

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:35.880
and you're not as amenable to propaganda once you're older than about, well, I would say, about 22 or  something like that

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.560
it's pretty young, actually; if you're gonna make a soldier, you have to get a soldier young

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.300
'cause once people are in their early twenties, say, they already have their personality developed

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:52.720
anyways, these policemen were sent into Poland after the Germans marched through

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.520
and, you know, it was wartime, and there was this hypothesis in Germany that

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.520
the Jews in particular were operating as a fifth column in undermining the German war effort

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:10.540
because of course the Germans blamed the Jews and a variety of other people for actually  setting up the conditions that made the war necessary

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:17.140
and the police were sent into Poland, they were also required to make peace, roughly speaking

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:23.200
they started out by rounding up all the Jewish men between 18 and 65

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.820
and gathering them in stadiums, and then shipping them off on trains, but that isn't where they ended

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:35.300
they ended in a very, very dark place, I mean these guys were going out in the field with naked pregnant women

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.680
and shooting them in the back of the head by the end of their training

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:45.760
and what's really interesting about that is that their commander told them that they could go home at any time

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.520
so this is not one of those examples of people following orders

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.860
and the reason they didn't, roughly speaking, there's many reasons, but one of the reasons they didn't

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:02.060
is because they didn't think it was comradely, so to speak, to leave the guys they were working with

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:07.320
to do all the dirty work and run off; and that's a really interesting fact

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.340
because in different circumstances you wouldn't think about that as reprehensible

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:19.300
you'd think: well, that's part of team work under rough circumstances; and that's at least in part how they viewed it

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:25.300
they were also made physically ill multiple times, physically and psychologically ill, by the thing that they had to do

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.900
but they kept doing them anyways, so one step at a time

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:35.640
and that's the thing, is that you end up in very bad place one step at a time, so you better watch those steps

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:45.740
anyways, Pinokio has now decided, after his latest misadventure, to return to the proper pathway

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:52.420
he's off to school again, and he's still pretty naive, although perhaps not as much so as he was before

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.740
so he decided that he's gonna do things right, he's gonna go get educated, he's going back to school

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.480
he's gonna take the conventional route to discipline, and be a good boy, roughly speaking

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:06.520
and so, he's off to school, and the fox waylays him again

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:12.780
this is a really interesting scene, took me quite a long time to unpack this too

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:20.260
and so, the fox, first of all, starts out by acting like he's sympathetic again, sympathetic towards Pinocchio

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:26.880
and so, he's empathetic, you could say, and... so this is an interesting analysis of empathy

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:33.420
so what happens is the fox convinces Pinokio through a variety of maneuvers

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:38.360
that he's actually not feeling very well, that he's sick, he really convinces him that he's a victim

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:47.320
and one of the things... I had a graduate student named Maya Maja Djikic, who had worked with the UN in  Bosnia

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.340
and she had toured some of the mass grave sites there, and we wrote a paper one time, called:

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.520
"You can neither remember nor forget what you don't understand"

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:03.600
and it was a paper about the idea, for example, it was partly about the idea that we should never forget the Holocaust

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.520
and that the idea there is that, well, we should never forget it and we should never repeat it

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.280
but the thing is, if you don't understand how those things come about, you can't really remember them, right?

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:19.140
you think about them as a set of historical facts, but that's not the kind of remembering that actually makes any difference

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:24.880
you have to understand the causal pathways, you have to understand how a society would transform in that manner

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.200
and more importantly, you have to understand the role of the individuals within that society

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:35.440
unless you're going to assume that they're so completely unlike you that there's no connection whatsoever

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.780
in which case you haven't remembered it at all, you haven't learned anything at all

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:45.120
because the right lesson from what happened in the 20th century is: this is what human beings are like

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.580
that's the correct lesson, and you can say: well, not me; but...

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:57.840
but probably you too, that's the thing, probably

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.080
and probably me too, and least under normal circumstances; anyways...

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:10.580
the Fox convinces Pinocchio that he's sick, he performs a lot of tricks to do this

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:15.600
now, you could say that Pinocchio is susceptible to this

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.980
because maybe there's still a part of him that's looking for the easy way out, and so...

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.880
one of the things that Maja and I found when we were writing this paper

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.040
we were looking at the discourse that precedes genocide and genocidal states

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.760
and the enhancement of a sense of victimization on the part of one of the groups

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.320
usually the group that's going to commit the genocide

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:41.260
first of all, their sense of being victims is much heightened by the demagogues

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.500
who are trying to stir up this sort of hatred, so they basically say: look, you've been oppressed in a variety of ways

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:51.440
and these are the people who did it, and they're not gonna stop doing it, and this time we're gonna get them before they get us

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:58.220
it's something like that; and so there's something very pathological about the enhancement of victimization

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:12.200
which is, well... see the problem as far as I'm concerned with it is, it's not thought through very well

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:20.440
because there's a point that's being made, and the point is that people have been oppressed and they suffer

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:31.040
and that's true, that point; but then the proper framework from within which to interpret that

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:38.740
I believe is that that's characteristic of life, you can't take it personally in some sense

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.640
and you can't divide the world neatly into perpetrators and victims

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:48.220
and you certainly can't divide the whole world neatly into perpetrators and victims and then assume that you're only in the victim class

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:55.180
and then assume that that gives you certain... like access to certain... forms of redress, let's say

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.220
it gets dangerous very rapidly if you do that sort of thing, so... For example,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:04.940
one of the things that characterized the Soviet Union - and this was particularly true in the 1920's - but also afterwards

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:12.980
the Soviets were very much enamored of the idea of class guilt.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:22.460
So, for example, although it was only about 40 years previously that the serfs had been emancipated, they weren't much more than slaves, right?

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.320
So that was the bulk of the Russian population. They were bought and sold along with the land.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:35.200
So, they had been emancipated and some of them - many of them - had turned into independent farmers

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.840
and some of them had become reasonably prosperous, because, at least in principle

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:47.020
well, I presume a certain proportion of them from being crooked, but I presume a larger proportion from actually being able to raise food

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:52.400
and of course, at that time the bulk of the Russian food population [sic] was produced by

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:58.860
these relatively successful peasant farmers; and relatively successful would mean

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:04.320
maybe they had a brick house or something, and maybe they had a couple of cows, and maybe they were able to hire a few people

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.460
so you know, it wasn't like they were massive land owners or anything

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:14.700
but I talked to you a little bit about the Pareto principle and the notion that in any domain of activity

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:19.200
a small proportion of people end up producing most of what's in that domain of activity

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:25.880
the same was true in Russia with regards to these peasant farmers, some of them were extraordinarily efficient

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.020
and they produced most of Russia's food

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:35.900
when the communists came in, they described those land holders as parasites, essentially

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:42.460
predicated on the Marxist idea that if someone had extracted profit from an enterprise

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:49.620
that the had basically stolen that profit from the people, say, that they had employed or otherwise oppressed

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:57.340
so you could be a member of the kulak [spells it out] class

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.620
and then because you were a member of that class, you were automatically guilty

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.660
so what happened was... and you gotta think this through to really understand what happened

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:12.340
so what happened was the intellectual communists were sent out in cadres out into these little towns

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:18.300
to find people who would help them round up the kulaks; now you gotta think about what a small town is like

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:23.980
because... so imagine you're in a town, and there's three or four people, or maybe ten people or something like that

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:29.280
who are a little more successful than everyone else, and a certain number of people are gonna be fine with that

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.000
any maybe eve happy about it, because they regard those people as particularly productive

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.900
and, you know, as stalwart members of the community, regardless of their flaws

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:43.040
but there's gonna be some people who are not happy about it at all, that are gonna be very resentful about that and jealous

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.800
and so those are gonna be people whose characters, I would say, are of the less positive type

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:55.840
and so when the intellectuals came in and described the reason that these people should be treated as parasites and profiteers

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:01.200
then it was the resentful minority in those towns, and that would be the kind of guy that hangs around in the bar all the time

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.440
and is completely unconscientious, and fails at everything, and then blames everyone else for it

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:11.440
the intellectuals came in and said: this is unfair that this happened to you

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:17.680
you've actually been victimized and now it's your opportunity to go have your revenge; and that's exactly what happened

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:26.540
now, in some of the villages sometimes the peasants would actually surround the farmsteads of these more successful people

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.320
and try to defend them, but that never worked out for very long

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:37.160
so then these mobs, these angry mobs, would go into the farmhouses and strip the place right down to nothing

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:44.000
and they packed these people up and sent them on trains with no food, out to Siberia where there was no place to live

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.820
so they were packed into houses, maybe they had a square meter each to live in

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.920
and their children died of typhoid and many of them froze to death

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.040
many, many people died, millions of people died as a consequence of the dekulakization

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.620
at least in... as a consequence of its total effect

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:09.120
so what happened then was that there wasn't any food produced

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:15.520
and so then six million Ukrainians starved to death in the 1920s, it's something you never hear about, right?

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.640
you never hear about that, why do you never hear about that? that's a question worth asking

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.320
you know, it was an absolute catastrophe, they used to...

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.260
so these people were starving, right to the point of cannibalism, right, I mean it was ugly

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.740
it was ugly as anything you could possibly imagine

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:36.600
if you were a mother and... so you're supposed to hand all your grain in to the central committee

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.720
most of it for distribution into the cities, you didn't get to keep any food yourself

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.760
and so maybe then afterwards, if you were a mother, you'd go out in the fields that had already been harvested

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:52.860
and you'd pick up individual grains of wheat, and if you didn't turn those in, they'd sh... that was death for you

00:18:52.860 --> 00:19:00.140
so that's how far it was pushed, so... well, so that's a little story about

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:07.260
how the idea of victimization and perpetration can get out of hand extraordinarily rapidly

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:18.000
so whenever people are beating the victim drum, you know, they'll cover that up with empathy, roughly speaking

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.340
we're speaking on behalf of the oppressed; it's like, maybe you are, but maybe you're no saint

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:29.440
because, you know, you're so sure that you're a saint and you're only speaking from the position of good

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.695
highly unlikely; anyways, so Pinocchio is enticed into believing that he's a victim

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:40.700
now, the logical part of that is that it is the case that, you know, you can make a very strong case that

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:46.500
every human being is in some sense involved in a tragic enterprise

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:51.740
right? because you're biologically vulnerable, you're not what you could be as a biological specimen, right?

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.500
you're full of imperfections and plus, you're going to be sick, and those you love are going to be  sick

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.980
and everything ends up in death, and so there's a very tragic element to that

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:07.480
and then, by the same token, you're also subject to the tyrannical aspect of your culture

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.500
right, 'cause it's forcing you to be a certain way all the time

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:22.540
socialization does that, you're required to modify your own intrinsic nature in order to come into conformity with the broader community

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:28.580
and you can think about that from the Piagetian sense, which is that socialization makes you a more and more sophisticated person

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:34.020
and there's some truth in that, but you can also be subject just to tyranny, you know

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:40.000
I see people in my practice, for example, they've had very tyrannical fathers, for example

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.180
sometimes they have tyrannical mothers as well, but they not so much encouraged

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.980
to integrate properly into the social community, as they are harassed and abused

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:54.600
or made to feel insufficient and, you know, basically subject to tyranny

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.320
and so it's quite... and that's true of everyone to some degree

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:05.660
you know, you come to university and there's a tyrannical aspect to it; especially in a big institution like this

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.620
you're not really marked out as an individual in any sense, you know

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:17.080
you're a number along with 60 thousand other people, and you know, there's something cold and impersonal about that

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.980
which is well represented in the design of this classroom, say

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.800
but by the same token, you know, the university provides you with an identity

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:31.280
while you're exploring an intellectual landscape, you know, you have a lot of freedom

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:38.040
compared to the vast majority of people, perhaps you don't have as much freedom as you might

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:45.400
if you compared it to some utopian notion of freedom, but in any real world sense, you're unbelievably well protected  by the university

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:51.940
partly because it stamps you with the identity "student", which is a respectable identity

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.380
and so you can go off and educate yourself as much as you can

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:59.840
and everyone in society says that's okay, they carve out the protected space for you

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.100
so at the same time as you're being tyrannized by the institution

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:10.420
and forced in some ways also to adopt the viewpoints, say, of the professors, depending on the professor

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:16.600
you're also the beneficiary of that, just like you're the beneficiary of this huge industrial infrastructure

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:23.940
that underlies everything that you do; so anyways, the  fact that your life is tragic necessarily

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:29.480
and that you are subject to oppression makes the victimization story really easy to swallow

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:34.720
but then there's a dark side of that, too; and this is actually what happens with Pinokio

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.500
so, what happens here is that he's told that he's ill

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.940
and convinced that he's ill, and they do use trickery, and...

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.300
so again you could look at him in some sense as an innocent victim, but

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:55.840
the innocence... the filmmakers do a good job of hedging against the innocent interpretation

00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:02.560
because what he's offered and accepts because he's ill is an easy way out

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.380
and so what the fox basically tells him is that he needs to have the vacation, because he's sick

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:11.860
and he can go off to Pleasure Island, which is this place of impulsivity, roughly speaking

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.580
and whim, it's like reversion to being two years old in some sense

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:21.000
and that he really needs that, because otherwise he's not going to be able to live properly

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.540
he's not going to be able to recover his health; and so what Pinokio is offered...

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:34.820
is the opportunity to abandon your responsibility as a reward for adopting the guise of victim

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:39.360
and that's really worth thinking about, because one of the things I thought about for a long time

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.160
is that... I've been trying to figure out what gives people's lives meaning

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.860
and tragedy gives life its negative meaning, and nobody disputes that

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:53.660
even if you're nihilistic, you're not going to dispute the fact that tragedy gives life negative meaning

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.380
so when nihilists say that life is meaningless, that isn't exactly what they mean

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:03.220
they mean that life is suffering, but there isn't anything transcendent about it that you could set against that suffering

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:08.580
that's nihilism, it's not that life is meaningless, that would just be neutral

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:15.060
it's like... no one believes that, they certainly don't act like they believe it

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:20.480
if you look at it technically, and we will as we progress through this class

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.340
in order to have any positive meaning in your life you have to have identified a goal

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.140
and you have to be working towards it, and there is a technical reason for that

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:35.940
and the technical reason, as far as I can tell is that the circuitry that produces the kind of positive emotion that people really like

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:44.600
is only activated when you notice that... when you're proceeding towards a goal that you value

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.860
and so that means that if you don't have a goal that you value, you can't have any positive emotion

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:54.260
so technically that's the incentive reward system, and it's... the underlying circuitry is dopaminergic

00:24:54.260 --> 00:25:03.280
and when that circuitry is activated then it's part of the exploratory circuit, it gives you the sense of being actively engaged in something worthwhile

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.480
and that's, you know, you tend to think of positive emotion as something produced by reward

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.560
but there's two kinds of positive emotion, one is the reward that's associated with satiation

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.020
and that's consummatory reward, and that's the reward you get when you're hungry and you eat

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:24.380
but the thing about eating when you're hungry is that it destroys the framework within which you were operating

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:31.460
it's time to eat, well, you eat, and that framework's no longer relevant, so the consummatory reward eliminates the value framework

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.260
and then you're stuck with: well, what are you gonna do next?

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:41.220
and so, the consummatory reward has with it its own problems, but the incentive reward is constantly what keeps you moving forward

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.860
and incentive reward, because it's dopaminergic, also is analgesic

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:51.500
literally analgesic; so if you are in pain, you take opiates, and that will cut the pain

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.880
but so will psychomotor stimulants, like cocaine or amphetamines

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:01.560
and so, it's literally the case that if you're engaged in something that's engaging, you're working towards a goal

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.980
that you're going to feel less pain; and you can see this happening with athletes, you know, they'll break their thumb or something

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:12.060
or maybe sometimes even their ankle, and they'll keep playing the game, 'course afterwards they're suffering like mad

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:20.100
but the fact that they're so filled with goal-directed enthusiasm means that, well, the pain systems are in some sense shut off

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:24.500
so that's an interesting thing, because what it suggests...

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:31.160
I mean, then you can imagine... I might say: well, how happy are you that you've made a certain amount of progress?

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:37.340
and if you think about it what you'd say is: well, it depends on how much progress and in relationship to what

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:43.340
so hypothetically you're gonna be happier if you'd made quite a bit of progress towards a really important goal

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:48.180
and then you have to think through what it means for a goal to be really important, 'cause that's not obvious

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:53.460
now, you could say: you're in this class, and you're listening to some information

00:26:53.460 --> 00:27:00.780
and maybe there's two reasons for that: you might find the information interesting per se, but let's forget about that for a minute

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:07.260
you need to listen to the information so that you can do well on the assignment, so that you can do well in the class

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.900
you need to do well in your class so that you can finish up your degree

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:14.220
you need to finish up your degree so that you can find your place in the world

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.920
you need to do that so that you're financially stable and maybe you can start a family and have a life

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.340
and that's all part of being a good person, something like that

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:32.880
and so, that's a hierarchy of goals, and you might say that being a good person would be the thing, however vaguely thought through, that's at the top of that hierarchy

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:39.860
and then, when you're doing things that serve that ultimate purpose, then you're gonna find those more meaningful

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.780
and that meaning is actually produced as a consequence of the engagement of this exploratory circuit

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:49.540
that's nested right down in your hypothalamus, it's really, really, old

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.560
it's as old as thirst, and it's as old as hunger, it's really an old system

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:59.920
and so, you wanna have that thing activated, I mean, at least from a...

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:05.260
well, it isn't only from a hedonic point of view, you know, it's a matter of being happy

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:09.480
it's the wrong way of thinking about it, it's much more complicated than that, it's... yes?

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:15.960
[student] I was actually just about to ask like a hedonic element, 'cause I'm just trying to understand

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:25.020
[student] this... I guess... not relationship but the differentiation between hedonism and satiation

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:30.940
[student] and you... like going back to when you mentioned that it's not that life is meaningless

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:35.820
[student] but hedonism isn't exactly... like it's not satiation, because

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.080
[student] at that point people are just doing what they're doing for the sake doing

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:48.180
[student] it's not just for activation of the dopaminergic system

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.080
[student] so I was trying to understand...

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:57.740
well, what I would say, we're going to into that A LOT once we're done with this, like a lot

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.220
but I'll go over it briefly, I mean, it's not merely hedonism

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:08.040
because there's an analgesic and also a fear-reducing element to pursuing a proper path

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:14.840
right, so there's control of negative emotion, but there's not just control of negative emotion and generation of positive emotion in the immediate future

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:20.100
which is kinda what you think about with regards to hedonism; actually, Pinokio takes a hedonic route next

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:25.700
the problem with the hedonic route is that... so the pursuit of pure happiness, let's say

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:31.760
is that what makes you happy in the next minute might not be something that will make you happy in the next hour

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.820
well you know that, there's this comic, what's his name, they call him king of the one-liners

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.880
he talked about drinking wine; don't you know that's gonna cause a hangover?

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.220
and he said: yeah, at the end, but the beginning and middle are excellent

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.500
and so that's really the problem with hedonism, right, is that

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.760
to pursue something that makes you happy in the immediate present

00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:00.920
risks sacrificing your, well, many things, but at least, let's say, your hedonism in the medium to long term

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:05.420
and of course that is one of the major problems with drug use, and alcohol's a really good example of that

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:10.460
because whatever hedonic kick you might get from it that moment at night

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:17.060
you're going to pay for almost completely or maybe even more so, because the next day you're

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:22.240
much more jittery and anxious, and that's a direct consequence of withdrawing from the drug

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.080
so when you're in... when you have a hangover you're in alcohol withdrawal

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.700
so that's how fast you get, roughly speaking, addicted to it

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:36.640
and so if you take another drink when you're hungover it'll cure it, but it's not a very useful cure

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.720
because all you do is push the inevitable hangover one more step into the future

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.840
and so part of the problem with the hedonic answer is: happy when?

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.360
exatly; and over what period of time? and also: who's happy?

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.480
because maybe something makes you happy but makes your family miserable

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.760
now, you could say, well, I don't care, but you do care if you have to live with your family

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:05.020
because they're gonna take it out on you; so the impulsive hedonism, which is also fostered, say, by a positive emotion

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:13.360
it tends to put people into a state of... the pursuit of short-term hedonism, it's not a good medium to long-term solution

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.980
I actually think that's why people evolved conscientiousness

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:24.940
right, 'cause conscientiousness is not happy, conscientious people aren't conscientious because it makes them happy

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:31.080
we're starting to think that they're conscientious because they actually feel terrible if they're just sitting around doing nothing

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:38.500
and so it's a way of staving off stress that's related to enforced leisure, something like that

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.340
you know, if you know industrious people, some of you are industrious

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:47.900
some of you will have industrious parents, they just can't sit around and do nothing, they have to be working

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:53.100
they don't feel good unless they're working; so one thing about conscientiousness is that

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:59.740
it involves continual sacrifice, right, you're doing difficult things in the present, hypothetically to make the future better

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:06.640
but that's not driven by hedonism by any stretch of the imagination; and conscientiousness is actually a pretty good predictor of long-term life success

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:12.680
in stable societies; 'cause there's also no point in being conscientious and saving things up

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:18.000
and storing things if a bunch of thugs are gonna just come in randomly and take it all away

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.880
so conscientiousness actually only works intelligently in societies that have some medium to long-term stability

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:29.580
you know, 'cause you can get wiped out by hyperinflation, too, 'cause hyperinflation kills off the conscientious people

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:34.320
the people who accrued debts are thrilled when hyperinflation kicks in, because it wipes out their debts

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:39.040
but of course those debts are the things they owed to people who were conscientious enough to save

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:47.520
so anyways, Pinocchio is transformed into a victim, and he's offered this identity, and he takes it

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.920
now, it's partly 'cause he's deceived and manipulated

00:32:50.920 --> 00:33:01.700
but it's also partly because the Fox offers him the abandonment of responsibility as payment for adopting the victim identity

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:08.960
so this is where his own lack of morality, let's say, 'cause this is all about Pinocchio's development as a character

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.020
plays a role in his demise

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:18.680
if I'm a victim, everyone else owes me something, and I don't have to take any responsibility

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.920
and so, one of the things I've wondered... here's something to think about:

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:31.020
it might be that the sense of meaning that life can provide to you is proportionate to the amount of responsibility you decide to take on

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:36.920
and that'd be very strange if it was the case, you know, because responsibility of course is a kind of weight, obviously

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:45.460
and it's difficult to take on responsibility; but if any positive emotion that you feel and your control of anxiety

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:53.140
and the control over pain is dependent on the activation of the systems that watch you move towards a desired goal

00:33:53.140 --> 00:34:01.920
then the more complete and weighty the goal is, the more kick there's going to be in the observation that you're moving towards it

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:07.060
and you know, you kinda already know this, because you'll have observed in your own life

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:13.760
that when you're engaged in something that you believe in, that the time passes properly

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:23.040
you know, you can see this even if you're... maybe you're reading a paper and it's actually related in some intelligible manner to something that you wanna learn

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:28.380
so even though it's difficult, you get engaged in it, you can remember it better, you process it better

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:34.360
and you're not so likely to fall asleep, and you're not so likely to wanna find distractions, all of that

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:40.680
you can get into it; and it would be very interesting if that was proportionate to the degree of responsibility

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.940
that you're willing to shoulder, and I think you can make a strong case for that

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:48.720
I've also often wondered: imagine you could offer people a choice

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:54.900
here's the choice: you can say, well, your life isn't meaningful, the nihilists have got it right

00:34:54.900 --> 00:35:00.700
there's no meaning in your life, and because of that there's no reason for you to accept any responsibility

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:06.240
so you can live a responsibility-free life and maybe one of impulsive pleasure-seeking

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:11.260
but a responsibility-free life; but the price you pay is that it doesn't get to be meaningful

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:16.820
or you could say to someone: no, we're gonna do the opposite, we're gonna say: you can live a meaningful life

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:22.460
but it's only gonna be as meaningful as the amount of responsibility that you're willing to bear

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:30.160
and then you might say: well, what would people choose? 'cause everybody always makes noises about wanting to have a meaningful life

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:41.020
but if the price you pay for that is the adoption of responsibility, then it's not so obvious people would choose meaning over pointless pursuits

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:48.600
if they had to... if the benefit they got for choosing the pointless pursuits was that they didn't have to care about anything they ever did

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.920
there's no responsibility, and that's really what Pinocchio is offered, and that's what the Coachman offers him

00:35:53.920 --> 00:36:01.380
and that's interesting, because, you know, so far it's been the Fox and the Cat, and they're kinda two-bit hoods

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:08.020
and so, the pathological pathway that they offer Pinocchio is not the worst of the pathological pathways

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:13.960
but here, at least as far as the imagination, the collective imagination that created this movie is concerned

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:19.360
this is where you get to the most pathological form of, let's call it temptation

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:28.060
and that's the temptation to engage in... to abandon responsibility and to engage in impulsive pleasure seeking

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.780
short-term pleasure seeking

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:37.860
so here's the Fox, pretending to be a doctor investigating Pinocchio's illness

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:44.520
and he makes some notes, which is all just meaningless scribble

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:51.640
it's like white noise, and it doesn't matter that the arguments that he's making  are completely incoherent

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.920
and it doesn't matter that he actually doesn't know anything, what he's selling is easy to buy

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:01.400
and so Pinocchio buys it

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:06.720
and by the end of the conversation with the Fox he's pretty convinced that he's useless

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.880
and that he needs a vacation; you know...

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:20.600
this is an oedipal situation as well, which I touched on the other lecture, I mean...

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:25.560
let's imagine that you have a child that is a little on the neurotic side, so high negative emotion

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:35.220
and maybe one that's also a little bit on the sickly side, so it has a variety of relatively minor ailments, but ailments nonetheless

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:42.020
and so what that means as a parent, we'll say mother for this example, 'cause I want to use the oedipal example

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:46.980
you have to make a decision all the time about exactly how you're gonna treat that child

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:54.680
one decision is: well, I'm not gonna... you don't have to go to school today, because you're not feeling well, but

00:37:54.680 --> 00:38:02.360
fair enough, but do you make the same decision the next day? and do you make the same decision the next day?

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:10.280
and let's imagine that you enable the child to avoid responsibility as a consequence of capitalizing on their illness

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:15.620
well then that's not gonna be very good for the child, the rule with a sickly child has to be something like:

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:22.320
I'm gonna push you right to your limit; because otherwise how is the person gonna figure out what they can do?

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:27.760
and if they can't figure out what they can do, then they're not gonna be able to make their way in the world at all

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:33.360
and then that gets muddied very badly if you're not exactly sure that you want them to make their way in the world, you know

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:38.920
maybe you're just as happy, because you'd be sitting at home, alone if your child was there with you

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.960
and maybe you'd be just as happy at some level if they never grew up at all

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:49.680
because then they won't leave; and maybe that's because you have a terrible marriage, and you're lonesome, you know

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.320
maybe it's an abusive marriage and your husband has chased away all your friends

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:57.520
and so you don't have anything at all, and maybe that's 'cause you didn't stand up for yourself very well

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.240
apart from the fact that he was, you know, tyrannical in his central nature

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:09.320
and so then all those little warps and bends in your psyche are gonna manifest themselves right...

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:14.360
right in the background of every one of those decisions

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:20.800
my daughter had a lot of illnesses when she was adolescent, and they were very serious, and

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:27.860
it was very difficult to figure out what to do about that, because you couldn't exactly apply normative rules, right?

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:35.740
and we always had to figure out if she was communicating her symptoms to us, how seriously to take those

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:42.300
and the answer was: the least amount of serious possible, it's something like that, because

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:47.980
we needed to know, and she needed to know, what she could do in spite of the fact that she  had problems

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:53.680
and one of the things I really tried to instill in her, and I think it worked, is that:

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.080
you don't ever wanna use your illness as an excuse for not doing anything

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.180
not consciously, you know, sometimes you might not know, "I'm not feeling well, what can I do?"

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:08.500
well you don't know, right, because sometimes when you're not feeling well, you can do more than you think, and sometimes you can do less than you think

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:14.260
it's not like it's obvious, but sometimes it's obvious, you know, this little temptation flits through your mind, and you think:

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:18.740
well, I don't really wanna do what I'm doing today, and I'm not feeling very well, so I don't have to do it

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.560
you do that a hundred times, and *you* don't know how sick you are anymore

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:29.560
and then you're in real trouble, because not only are you sick, but you actually have... you've muddied the waters

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:36.500
and so you have both problems, is you're actually ill, and you've  betrayed yourself

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:40.720
by using that as an excuse not to pursue your responsibilities

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:45.820
and that, I think, if both of those thing happen to you at the same time, you're in real trouble

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.540
and it's really hard not to have that happen

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:54.060
so anyways, Pinokio gets enticed into believing he's a victim

00:40:54.060 --> 00:41:04.220
the fact that he's insufficient is used as an excuse by the fox and the cat to offer him a trip to Pleasure Island

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:07.460
and this is, I think, where the movie gets particularly dark

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:11.840
and so off they go, singing away; they have to carry him

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:18.200
so you could say in some sense he's carried by societal pathology and his own trouble

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:24.520
he's carried like a puppet off to Pleasure Island; and so the Cricket...

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:29.100
the Cricket is again left behind, he's not the world's best conscience at this point

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:36.400
so, Pinokio goes off to meet the Coachman, and the Coachman has already said he's collecting bad little boys

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:41.840
and he's got them on the coach, they're all delinquent types here

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.540
and the ticket on the coach was the ace of spades, which is what Pinocchio is holding

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:51.140
and he's with this character here, called Lampwick

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:56.940
and that's an interesting name, so he's the thing that burns in the middle of a light, lamp wick

00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:02.600
and that's interesting, because it's a play on Lucifer, 'cause Lucifer means 'bringer of light'

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:07.880
and so Lampwick is a play on that, and Lampwick is really a nasty piece of work

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:13.460
he's got this false arrogance about him, he's got this cynical voice, really deeply cynical voice

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:18.340
and he's only... I don't know how old he's supposed to be in this, maybe 12 or something like that, 13

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:22.700
And so he's one of those kids who's become prematurely cynical

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.300
I'll tell you a story about that

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:31.220
so I used to live in Montreal, I lived in a poor neighborhood

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:39.500
and one day I was out in the back alley, building a fence, 'cause I was putting a fence around my little tiny back yard

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:45.980
and there was a house across the alley down the street aways, where there was a lot of, like

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:51.900
not good partying, a lot of bikers were hanging around there, ans I knew there was a little kid that lived there as well

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.140
anyways, I was out there in the back alley, pounding away on my fence, and these little kids came up

00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:02.920
and they were little, they were like 3 and 4 years old, hey, and they spoke joual

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:07.560
a kind of really heavily accented quebecois french, and my french isn't good

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:13.300
so I could hardly understand them; but they were watching me hammer, and they got a little closer

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:17.640
and they had one kid who was clearly the leader, had a real scowl on his face, eh?

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:22.100
and so they were watching, and I kinda motioned to one of them, that they could use the hammer

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:27.600
and that kid said, and I'm gonna mangle this, but he said "je voulai" or something like that

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:33.220
and what it meant is "I'll steal that"; and so I thought... you know, and then he came over and he tugged on it

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:38.980
and he wanted to take it, and he was quite angry that I wasn't gonna let him take it, and then so...

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:44.860
so I couldn't engage him, I couldn't get him to play, you know, and his buddies were sort of hanging around behind him, and

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:49.740
they wouldn't come and play, because he wouldn't, and so he was hostile right away to me

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:58.200
and then... so the fence piece was laying out in the alley, and these little monsters started running across it

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:04.700
which I thought was really remarkable, you know, but it was terrible at the same time, because they were really little kids

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:09.840
that shouldn't be happening when you're like 3 or 4; if that's happening at that age, things are not good

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:15.240
and so that kid was already like seriously not happy with the world

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:20.700
and you know, I've been studying antisocial behavior for a long time by that point, and I knew that

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:28.400
the kids who are destined to jail later in their lives are kids who are rough and tough when they're two years old, but then don't get socialized

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:35.780
or maybe worse, they get anti-socialized, which is exactly what happened to this kid, he'd obviously been ignored and abused

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:43.460
certainly no one had ever played with him in any real way, because he wouldn't play; and it's not good if a kid is that little

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:50.920
and you can't get them to play, something's gone seriously wrong, 'cause they're so playful at that age, that it's like 90% of them

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.960
anyways, so they were running back and forth on this fence, I thought, stomping on it, you know

00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:02.540
and I was right there, I thought, well, first of all I thought that was remarkable, but I also thought it was absolutely horrifying, because

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:06.760
you know, in some sense I could see where this kid was headed and why

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:12.200
at that early stage in his life, it's really... it's not a pleasant thing to behold

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:16.880
but there was nothing that could be done about it, and that... kinda what this Lampwick is like

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.900
he's prematurely cynical, this kid was already cynical, and he was like 4 years old

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:29.600
you know, most kids don't get cynical 'till they're teenagers, and then often they don't get completely cynical and usually they more or less grow out of it

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:35.380
but it happened to him much earlier; so this Lampwick character, he's already decided that

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:40.020
he knows everything, that everyone else's opinion is worth nothing

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:46.880
and that there's nothing in cultre or society that holds any utility whatsoever for someone like him

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:54.240
now, you can imagine developing that way, if you were raised in a family where people were generally lying to you

00:45:54.240 --> 00:46:01.720
and that they randomly treated you or neglected you, and that you couldn't discern anything about them that was admirable or positive

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:09.780
of course you assume the whole structure is corrupt, and that you had to take care of yourself, and no one else

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.660
well, not of course, not everyone assumes that under those situations, I shouldn't say "of course"

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:19.060
but it's a logical set of conclusions, so...

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:26.280
and of course it's proportionate to some degree to how much abuse you tak, althought there are lots of stories of people who've been terribly abused as children

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:33.140
who grew up to be, you know, kind, remarkable, responsible, thoughtful

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:37.220
people who were absolutely opposed to abuse, instead of propagating it

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:40.080
there's no direct causal pathway

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:47.720
anyways, Lampwick is pretty happy to be on this coach way to Pleasure Island which he's heard about

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:54.120
he said, "well, it's all you can eat, all you can smoke, you don't have to do any work, you can do anything you want"

00:46:54.120 --> 00:47:00.520
so you might say, well, it's too good to be true, like the ginger bread house in the Hansel and Grettel story

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:07.660
right, the kids are lost, there's a ginger bread house, it's a house, which is something they need, and it's made out of cookies

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:13.400
it looks like it's a little bit too good to be true, and of course in the house there's the negative part of that

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:24.660
which is the old witch who wants to eat children; and that's a story about what happens to people if they're offered more than they should be offered

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:32.180
so... anyways, Lampwick is firing off... he has a little slingshot

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:39.380
and he's firing off pebbles at the horses who are pulling the carriage, and that's just the kind of guy that he is

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:46.200
so he takes Pinocchio under his wing; and the Cricket is down there in the dust, he's caught back up to the carriage

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:50.420
but he's having a rough time at this point

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:54.300
this is also a story, to some degree, about transitioning to adolescence

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:59.840
you know, because adolescence is a time when people are pretty impulsive, and their view is quite short-term

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:06.620
and are more likely to pursue immediate pleasures and all of that, and that can get really out of hand, so...

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:13.940
anyways, they separate from the mainland, and go on a boat, and so they're off to Pleasure Island

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:24.580
a dark place; and the Coachman opens the gates and lets the delinquents into Pleasure Island, and

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:35.780
they basically have a riot; and this is Pleasure Island, here, it's full of amusement park rides, and

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:42.540
you know, one of the things that's kind of interesting about horror movies, I'm sure you've noticed this, is that they're often set in amusement parks

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:50.280
and clowns are often characters of horror, we'll leave the clowns aside for now, but the amusement park thing, that's pretty interesting

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:55.280
why in the world would an amusement park be a place of horror?

00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:02.920
and the first question might be: well, have you ever been to an amusement park? because there is something about them, that's really...

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:08.020
they have a dark side, a clear dark side, and part of it is that

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:16.680
people with nothing better to do are spending money stupidly, and they're being fleeced by the people who operate the amusement park

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:22.800
you know, and they have, let's say, a stereotypically dark reputation

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:27.500
and they're moving around all the time, this is also something that psychopaths do

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:32.720
and all they're doing is moving from community to community, and taking the money from the rubes, fundamentally

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:37.280
and so, the amusement park, well...

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:45.080
if you walk through an amusement park with that sort of thing in mind, maybe that's also coloring your vision, of course, but

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:53.280
it's something that you could see very immediately; so there's something about them that's deeply sad, but there's also an underlying horror that characterizes them

00:49:53.280 --> 00:50:00.280
it's easy for a horror movie or horror novel writers to immediately expand upon, there's something about it that

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:04.620
that makes sense to people, so...

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:09.860
it's too easy, maybe that's... and it's also all short-term gratification, that's the other thing

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.940
so you spend your money very rapidly, and it's gone; yes?

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:17.820
[student] seems like a celebration of meanings divorced from reality (?)

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.480
 

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:24.820
yes, exactly, well, that's the impulsive element; the comment was it's a celebration of meanings divorced from reality

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:31.200
yeah, it's also outside of reality, right, that's why it's on an island, it's a separate universe

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.180
and it's a universe where nothig that's happening is connected to anything outside

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:41.520
and you're spending your hard-earned money, let's say, but it isn't that much... it's certainly not an investment

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:48.600
it's not that much different than burning it, well, it is, because of course you get some pleasure out of it, but

00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:57.880
it isn't... going there every day is probably not the wisest move that you could make, so...

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:05.700
the animators do a good job of, well, of presenting the, what would you call it

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:13.760
the enforced hedonism, I guess I would say, of a place like that; this is a place where you're gonna have fun, that's what it's for, so...

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:19.560
anyways, Lampwick, who's got this very arrogant look on his face, and this kind of strut

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.500
it's a bravado, that's what it's called, it's a false confidence

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:30.440
it's the sort of thing that people do when they're trying to impress upon others that they're high in the dominance hierarchy

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:34.200
but really they're not, so it's a mimicry of dominance

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:42.340
but it's something that can be intimidating, there's no doubt about it

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:48.000
I had a friend, he didn't come to a good end

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.800
this person who was a real good friend of mine, when I was in junior high and high school, and he was kind of crazy

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:59.920
and he was tall, he was a bout six foot seven, and he was pretty thin

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:06.660
and we used to go out to the bar now and then, and in many of the bars that we were in, we lived in this little town

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:12.480
there were bullies, and these were guys... and I worked in the bars, and I used to watch these guys, and they'd basically...

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.920
there was a handful of them in town, pretty psychopathic types

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.100
and they'd go to the bar, and all they'd do is sit there and wait for someone to come in who they could beat up

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:24.480
they knew who it was as soon as they walked in, that's actually why they were at the bar

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:32.900
and so they'd wait 'till someone came in, who didn't look very confident, and who could likely be intimidated by this sort of thing, and then they'd

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:39.920
tell him to come outside for a fight, and if they didn't, well then they'd of course make fun of him, and if they did, well, generally they'd beat them up

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:46.260
my friend kinda caught on to this trick, and he started going into bars, and every time that someone like that came near him

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:50.300
he'd go outside and fight with them; and one of the things he observed right away is that

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:55.340
almost inevitably when he went outside with them, they'd shake hands and make friends

00:52:55.340 --> 00:53:01.540
so as soon as he... and it was realy remarkable, watching him, 'cause he wasn't a particularly physically powerful person

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:07.960
although he was extraordinarily tall; but he had started to play this game, and he did it for  along time, and

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:14.320
I don't remember him ever actually having to fight, he just stared them down, fundamentally

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:23.700
so it was a very interesting thing to watch, but it was an indication to me of exactly how shallow this kind of bravado, bullying actually is

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:32.360
but people don't find that out, because they won't stand up, and it's not surprising, but...

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:38.540
anyways, they load up on food, Pinocchio's carrying a pie and a an ice cream cone simultaneously

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:44.060
and then they're off to have a fight, and Lampwick says something like:

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:48.980
it's good to punch someone in the nose sometimes just for the, I think he says, heck of it

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:52.900
and so Pinokio adopts this strut, and in they go to the roughhouse

00:53:52.900 --> 00:54:01.480
and then, in the next scene, you see this model home up for destruction, it's quite an interesting scene symbolically, you see...

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:08.740
in the middle of this house here there's a stained-glass window that has a mandala on it, we'll see it more clearly in a minute

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:14.320
and a mandala is a sacred symbol of the Self, that's the Jungian interpretation

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.200
it's a symbol... it's very difficult to describe, but it's a symbol...

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:26.760
music is a mandala, except it's  played out across time, so you could say that thing is the same as music, but it's kinda like a slice of music

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:34.900
it's the same idea, you know sometimes you see those slow-motion or sped-up-motion videos of a flower unfolding?

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:40.300
that's the same idea, you can imagine that being se to music, and somehow that would make sense

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:47.220
and the mandala's like a symbol of the unfolding of being, or the source of meaning, or something like that

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:52.860
and it's also a symbol of the Self from the jungian perspective

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:57.000
so there you see it more clearly; the kids are starting to burn this place

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:03.180
and trash it, and they're dragging the grand piano down the stairs, it's a destruction of high culture

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:08.320
about which they are nothing but cynical, 'cause they don't believe that hard work and sacrifice can

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:16.560
can produce something of any value, and they want to bring it down and destroy it, and that's partly because...

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.160
you can see this in the story of Cain and Able

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:25.860
Able is hardworking and everyone likes him, and he makes the proper sacrifices, and so his life goes pretty well

00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:31.340
and that's part of the reason Cain hates it, and he's jealous and resentful, but worse than that

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:36.400
if you're around someone, if you're not doing very well, especially if that's your own fault

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:40.960
if you're not doing very well, and you're around someone who's doing very well, it's very painful, because

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:46.840
the mere fact of their being judges you, and so it's very easy to wanna destroy that

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:55.700
to destroy that ideal so that you don't have to live with the terrible consequences of seeing it embodied in front of you

00:55:55.700 --> 00:56:02.880
and so part of the reason that people wanna tear things down is so that they don't have anything to contrast themselves against and to feel bad

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:11.180
and that's exactly what's happening here, the kids are destroying all of this culture, roughly speaking

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:19.440
because it judges them; the fact that it exists judges them; and I've often thought this about Michelangelo's statue of David

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:25.580
which is this heroic... so David was a shepherd, obviously, and it doesn't sound like much, but

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:30.940
back in those times being a shepherd was a big deal, because there were lions, and you had a slingshot

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:35.360
so like, you've got to defend your sheep from lions with a slingshot

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:41.340
so you weren't exactly this, like, 19th century English guy dressed in a, you know, frilly blue suit

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:48.160
you were tough as a bloody... well, someone who would go after a lion with a slingshot, it's no joke

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:54.140
anyways, the statue is very heroic, and, you know, you look at that, you think, well, that's the possibility of human kind

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:59.700
but by the same token it's also what you're not, and so, as well as being an ideal, it's a judge

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.900
and every ideal is a judge, so... yes?

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:10.960
[student] going back to your example of Cain and Able, um, so you're using that as an example illustrating

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:22.960
[student] becoming bitter as a result of not being able to achieve status... success as a result of hard work

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:34.200
[student] but in the example of Cain and Able, um, like one was a shepherd, and one was a farmer, and the one who was favored

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:39.780
[student] so was that a result of the hard work or was that a result of... (agriculture being favored?)

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:45.180
good question, those stories are very compicated

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:51.100
and the story is very ambivalent about whether Cain is not rewarded because he makes bad sacrifices

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:56.320
or beause God's just in a bad mood; I like that... if you read the story

00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:02.340
I read multiple translations of the story, and when Cain comes to God to complain

00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:09.680
God basically tells him: look, buddy, before you go about criticizing the structure of reality

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:16.800
you should look to your own inadequacies; he says: sin crouches at your door like a predatory, sexually aroused animal

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:21.980
and you invited it in to have its way with you, and something has emerged as a consequence

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:26.140
so don't be botherin' me about my creation before you look to yourself

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:35.420
so there's a very strong hint that the reason that God has not favored Cain's sacrifices because they weren't of particularly good quality

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:41.460
but it is ambivalent in the story, and there is the sheperd versus farmer motif as well

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:47.540
and of course that motif runs through the entire corpus of stories to some degree, especially the shepherd motif

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:53.920
so, it's only about a paragraph long, that whole story and it packs all that into that tiny little amount of space

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:58.540
but the idea that Cain kills Abel to get rid of his ideal

00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:04.340
and also to punish God, roughly speaking, it's a brilliant story; I mean...

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:09.520
these guys who go around shooting up highschools, they're shooting at... highschools in particular, but...

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:16.860
you know, they're definitely out for revenge, and what they're revenging themselves against or to who is not exactly clear

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:20.780
anyways, so these kids are just tearing down this model home

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:26.380
tearing down western civilization, I suppose is another way of looking at it, or just tearing down civilization, period

00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:31.680
and Pinokio's having a pretty good time, he's got his axe, and he's looking a little malevolent there

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:36.640
and happy to be destroying things, which is of course a pretty simple thing to do

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:42.000
so there's that image that I told you about, the mandala, and that's a flower in this image

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.500
and so, what happens is that, I think it's Lampwick, throws a brick through it

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:54.540
and so, what that means symbolically: the self is a symbol of your potential, among very many other things

00:59:54.540 --> 01:00:03.680
but by engaging in this sort of impulsive, destructive activity Lampwick and Pinocchio are making it impossible to further their development

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.500
and they're doing that to some degree consciously, they basically say: to hell with it

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:16.320
and toss a brick through this highest ideal, the thing through which light shines, so also that harkens back to the star as well

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:21.700
so, anyways, the coachman is paying attention to all this

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:28.580
and he's actually pretty happy about the fact that these boys are so involved in their stupid amusements

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:32.180
that they're not paying any attention to what's actually going on

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:36.240
he calls these people out of the darkness, these creatures out of the darkness, so...

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:42.120
you get these black... you can hardly see them there, but theyre black cloaked figures with glowing eyes

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:46.880
and they're shutting the door of the amusement park

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.700
and that's very interesting, it's an extraordinarily interesting happening

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:55.980
it's like, ok, so all of a sudden the amusement park... we already know that the Coachman is up to no good

01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:00.860
but now he's got these minions that are faceless in some sense, they're clearly creatures of the night

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:05.080
and they're up to no good, and so you have this sense that...

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:09.340
that the boys are being offered bread and circuses, roughly speaking

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:12.940
but there's something... there's a real reason for it, there's a manipulative reason

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:21.560
for it, they're being enticed into a trap, the doors are closed, and these underground beings are involved in the plot

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:28.880
and obviously the coachman understands this perfectly well; so one of the ways to understand this

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:33.220
is to think about what totalitarian states have to offer their populace, and

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.780
what they offer them, and this happened particularly as Rome declined, let's say

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:40.440
that's where the term bread and circuses originally came from, is that

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:46.900
as the situation degenerates, then people have to be offered stupid amusements more and more frequently

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:52.580
in order for them ignore what's actually going on in the background

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:56.060
you know, a war can be that kind of stupid  amusement

01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:03.700
anyways, later that night the entire place is completely devastated, and all we see is the wreckage of everything that was there before

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:08.960
and again the Cricket has gotten separated from Pinocchio, and so he's trying to find him

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:14.960
and Pinocchio ends up in this... this bar that's shaped like an 8-ball

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:21.020
the 8-ball is kind of the random ball in pool, and anyways he's inside the 8-ball, and

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:28.040
he's shooting pool with Lampwick, and that's just another indication of wasting his time, basically, and

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:33.920
you can see in the forefront there's some cards for gambling, so he's engaged in these sort of

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:43.500
you might say, pointless, hedonic hedonic pursuits, and he's enticing Pinocchio along the same route, and so

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:51.640
he teaches him to smoke, first, that doesn't go very well, so Pinocchio takes a huge drag on his cigar

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:56.660
and it just about kills him, and when Lampwick asks him how he likes it

01:02:56.660 --> 01:03:03.100
he shakes his head and says, you know, that it's really, was really quite good, but he's so sick that he can hardly stand up

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.980
and he's hallucinating double balls on the pool table, and

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:11.920
then the cricket shows up and stands on the 8-ball, and kinda gives him one of those declamatory speeches again

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:19.600
you know, 'cause he still hasn't quite figured out that standing up proud and spouting off the rules isn't exactly

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:25.940
the right way for the conscience to behave; and Lampwick picks him up by the scruff of the neck

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:32.160
roughly speaking, and first of all asks who he is, so obviously he's divorced from his own conscience

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:37.920
and then makes fun of Pinocchio for paying attention to this little bug, and

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:42.680
that's kind of a nice indication of what happens at adolescence, you know, because

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:49.540
of course as children move away from their parents and into their groups, especially when the groups are misbehaving

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:56.740
often what happens is that the other members of the group will torture a person who isn't willing to try something dangerous or foolish

01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:01.880
by making fun of the fact that they're, you know, too attached to their conscience

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:09.460
there's a positive element to that, because you should take some risks when you're a teenager, and also later in life, and so

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:14.180
if you won't take any risks, there's actually something wrong with you, but there's a negative element in that

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:22.640
well, you know, teenagers do all sorts of stupid things, and perhaps it's amazing that we all live all live through it actually, as far as I'm concerned

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:28.060
some people take extraordinary risks, extraordinary risks

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:34.700
and they don't make it through at all or they end up in the permanently antisocial population

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:42.660
and then they're, you know, basically carreer criminals; five percent of the criminals commint 95% of the crimes

01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:46.680
it's another Pareto distribution, so...

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:53.520
anyways, Lampwick isn't gonna listen to Pinocchio or to the Cricket, he laughs at him with this kind of braying laugh

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.700
which is some foreshadowing, and the Cricket gets all upset, puts his coat on backwards

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:05.580
and ends up dumped down a pool table hole, and otherwise abused, and so

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:10.240
he stomps on out of there, he tells Pinocchio that he can take care of himself, and he stomps on out of there

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:17.120
and so Pinocchio is left without the guidance of conscience, and the Cricket is trying to figure out how to get off Pleasure Island

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:23.100
BUT! he goes through the gates and he sees what's actually going on

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:28.080
and what's going on is that the Coachman had this like slave boat

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:35.440
down in the bowels of the island, and he's got all these black-suited minions with the glowing eyes

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.460
working for him, and they're rounding up what looked like donkeys

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:45.560
and so they're beast of burden, right? and so there's an idea here that if you produce...

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:50.200
if you pursue impulsive pleasure to the detriment of the development of your character

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:54.800
you're going to end up a beast of burden, you're going to end up a slave to a tyrant

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.140
and that's exactly right, and so, anyways, the Cricket doesn't...

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:05.100
you can see one of those black-suited horrors here, hauling donkeys out of this crate

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:09.300
and one of them has a hat on, and they look very sad

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:14.480
and they're in different crates, and one of them says: sold to the salt mines, and one of them says: sold to the circus

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:19.200
so they're shipped off to be slaves, roughly speaking

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:24.440
and they look very sad, and then one of them gets hauled out of a crate, and he's still got a hat on

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:29.860
he has a hat on and a sweater, and he can still talk, he's a boy, it turns out

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:35.980
that's been half-transformed into a jackass, a brying jackass prior to being enslaved

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:42.080
so that's another thing that's quite interesting about the story, you know, it also makes the case that if you

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:50.460
replace your voice with stupid braying, that the probability that you're going to become enslaved by a tyrant is extraordinarily high

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:57.260
and I always can't help but think about ideologues in that manner, you know

01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:02.220
Solzhenitsyn wrote about the radical left ideologues that got thrown in the gulag archipelago, you know

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:06.480
so they were part stalwarts, this happened to a lot of people, true believers

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:12.300
who were vacuumed up by the stalinist machine and thrown into the gulag anyways, and

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:16.800
he said that those people suffered in some ways more than everyone else, because

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.240
what did he say? they were  bit by the beloved hand that fed them

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:24.340
and so the first while when they were in the camps, Solzhenitsyn didn't really know what to do with people like that

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:29.680
because on the one hand, well, they were in the camps, and wasn't that awful, and they've been torn away from their family

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.620
and you know, stripped of all their identity, and their status, so that's pretty rough

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:38.120
but on the other hand they were writing letters protesting their innocence

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:46.300
and assuming that everyone else in the camp was guilty, but they were innocent, and they were still strident believers in the communist process

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:51.400
and so, you know, it was a conundrum, here they are being terribly punished

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:56.460
but by the same token they're also the perpetrators of their own demise, so how do you deal with them?

01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:00.680
they used to play "comrades", he said they used to play "comrades" with people like that

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:08.180
and invite them into an ideological discussion about the camp situation, and the situation in the country as a whole

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:14.320
and let them rattle out their ideological justifications for everything that had happened

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:19.840
trying to make them parody themselves, roughly speaking, it was a rough game

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:28.360
and Solzhenitsyn also concluded that there was no helping someone like that

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:34.140
when they were still ensconced inside that braying ideology, you could predict everything they were going to say

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:39.240
it's like someone had a crank, you could just crank it, and out would come the proper ideological formulas

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:44.580
but then he realized that as soon as they, let's call it, repented of that

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:48.620
and started to realize they're own role in it or the error of the system

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:57.020
then he would start communicating with them, you know, as if they were people who you could communicate with

01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:59.960
yeah, that was very interesting, as far as I'm concerned

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:05.200
anyways, this kid is still a little bit human, he starts to cry for his mom

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:09.560
and the Coachman basically throws him back into the crate and says that he's not ready yet

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:14.560
and the reason for that is that he could still... he still had the power of independent speech

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.600
you remember, right at the beginning of the movie, when the mouth was painted on Pionokio

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:26.660
we saw that mask that was really glaring at the process, I said that character recurrs continuously throughout the movie

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:32.200
and this is a good example of that, because the Coachman is the enemy of anything that has it's own voice

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:38.600
so he's the anti-Gepetto, that's a good way of thinking about it, he's the tyrannical aspect of the culture

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:44.900
but insofar as one of these mostly donkeys, mostly jackasses can still talk

01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:53.060
then they're not completely fit for slavery; and you remember this movie was also being made at about the same time that

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:59.160
the Nazi transformation of Germany was taking place, and so all these terrible ounderground things

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:06.500
you know, this process whereby people were being reduced to ideological slaves, say

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:11.160
and in this terrible process that was all playing out in Europe in a very big way

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:18.880
It was not that people were not aware of that. It was in the air. So...

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:25.600
Anyway, the donkeys and the jackass can still talk.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.840
Crying and complaining and repenting, and

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:33.060
the Coachman turns into a  full tyrant again cracks a whip if I remember correctly,

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.980
and says: "You had your fun, and now you're gonna pay for it."

01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:41.580
The Cricket gets word of all this, he gets wind of it, he starts to understand what happened

01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:46.500
is that all these bad kids were enticed out onto this island so that they could be enslaved

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:50.360
and he's really taken aback by that, to say the least

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:57.240
when he realizes what's going on, so he runs back to find Pinokio, and then the scene switches back to the 8-ball bar where

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:03.400
where Lampwick is drinking beer and complaining about what the conscience said

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.400
you know, 'cause he's kinda guilty and ashamed, but he won't admit it, 'cause he doesn't admit anything

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:14.060
he knows everything, he's not gonna admit anything about himself that isn't perfect, he's a real totalitarian in training

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:18.160
and he drinks this beer, and he's laughing about the conscience and putting him down

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.340
and then he says, well, what does he say exactly...?

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:26.500
"what does he think I am, a jackass?" or something like that, maybe that's not the words exactly

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:34.360
and then he grows these ears, and Pinokio sees that and immediately takes a look at the beer and stops drinking it

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:40.240
and then Lampwick transforms one more time, and his face turns into the face of a donkey

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:46.340
and he's laughing still, and then his hands... oh yes, he laughs and then he starts to bray

01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:53.680
like a jackass, he's horrified by that, and then Pinokio laughs, and the braying comes out as well

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:57.760
so now they're absolutely horrified, and Lampwick actually figures out what's going on

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:03.100
he figures out that he's been tricked and that he's transforming and he's completely horrified by it

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:08.720
he becomes conscious of what's happening to him; and there's one particularly, I would say, dramatic scene where

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:18.020
his hands have transformed into hooves, and he's kicking and leaping around the room in panic

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:23.020
and he comes up to a mirror, he sees himself as the jackass, and then he turns around and breaks the mirror

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:27.560
so, you know, he's self-conscious for a moment, then he destroys his capacity for self-consciousness

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:32.520
then he transforms entirely into a jackass, he's farther down the road than Pinokio [should be 'further']

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:37.760
and he comes crawling to Pinokio to save him, and asks that the conscience comes back

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:41.260
so that he can get out of this, but of course it's a bit too late, and

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:45.860
so then Pinokio grows jackass ears, and

01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:49.980
he's absolutely terrified by it as well, he knows what's coming

01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:56.620
and the cricket comes back, and guides him off Pleasure Island, and so then they end up on a cliff

01:12:56.620 --> 01:13:01.460
because this is an island, after all, and they have to jump into the unknown

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:08.360
right, out of this impulsive, adolescent, hedonic playground into the unknown

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.800
and that's how they escape; so that's the first time that Pinokio has to leave...

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:21.440
this is the first scene where he has to jump into the water to make a clean break from something pathological

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:27.760
so tyranny... you see this echoed... you see echoes of this in the story of Moses leading his people from Egypt

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:34.580
because Moses is a master of water, right? he hits a rock with a stick and water comes out of it

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:39.200
and he's floating on water when he's an infant, and he parts the red sea, and

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:47.340
so he's a master of water and transformation, and the pharaoh's kingdom is represented as desert stone, roughly speaking

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:52.300
and so, the idea there is that, well, the kingdom is solid ground

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:59.860
but it can be a tyranny, and the water is chaos, but it can be the thing that you have to leap into to free yourself from the tyranny

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:07.780
it's not like in the Moses story that that comes easy, right, because the Hebrews leave Egypt, which is a terrible tyranny

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:10.480
and you think, well, that's good, they escaped from the tyranny

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:15.040
that isn't what happens, they escape from the tyranny, they actually end up somewhere arguably worse

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.520
'cause they're wandering around in the desert for forty years

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:22.880
and that's... it's a brilliant element of that story, because it states clearly that

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:28.020
when you go from a bad place to a better place you go to a worse place first

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:31.200
and that's a great... it's a great thing to know

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:35.800
because it also tells you why you might be unwilling to take the next step

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:41.780
you know, you're aiming up, but in order to aim up you have to let go of something you already have

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:43.940
and then that will put you into a state of chaos

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:49.420
and unless you're willing to undergo that intermediary state of chaos, and you might not recover from it

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:54.480
you're not gonna get to the next level

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:58.720
so that's rough, well, so Pinokio, he decides that chaos is better than tyranny

01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:02.820
and guided by his conscience

01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:06.080
we don't see anything happening in the water in this particular scene

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:13.540
they come back to shore all half-drowned and exhausted by their adventure

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:22.120
and they go back home, and I think maybe we'll take a break now, let's see, this is a good time to take a break

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:27.780
1:30, perfect, so let's break for 15 minutes, okay? alright

01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:37.540
alright, so

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:45.220
Carl Jung talked about this phenomenon he...

01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:52.040
he described as retrogressive restoration of the persona

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:59.820
and so, it's a complicated idea, but basically what it means is that sometimes you take a leap forward

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:05.840
and you learn some things, but you can't catalyze a new identity, so you try to go back and hide in your old identity

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:14.720
and that actually doesn't work, because, well, things have changed, and you've learned something, and that isn't who you are anymore

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:21.940
and so it's like you have to cut parts of yourself off in a destructive manner to fit back into the person that you were

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:28.740
now, what happens here is that Pinokio escapes from this tyrannical situation

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:34.080
and undergoes this descent into chaos, but he tries to go back home, he tries to go back to what he was

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:42.220
and he can't do that anymore, his father isn't at home anymore, and so

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:48.400
so when he goes home he finds that there's no home there, now

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:52.660
this happens to people sometimes, and it's often a shock to them, so

01:16:52.660 --> 01:17:01.620
one of the things I've noticed about Peter Pan type... I'm gonna speak about men here, because I've observed it more in men

01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:07.880
is that they often stay under the thumb of their father, and you think, well

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:12.720
why would someone do that, because it means they subject to the tyrannical judgment of their father

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:19.080
they're always concerned about what their father would think or whether their father approves of them and so forth

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:26.760
and you think, well, that's gotta be an unpleasant place to be, why would you do that?

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:31.700
one of the things that I've suggested to my clients and to other people sometimes is that...

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:37.860
here's a weird little exercise that you can undertake, a little thought experiment

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:42.900
so you have your parents and of course your parents have friends who are about their age, and

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:48.660
maybe some of them are people you only know peripherally, and I might ask you, well

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:55.040
do you care more about what your parents think than you care about what these peripheral people who know your parents think?

01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:01.520
and then the answer to that is, well, of course, and then the question that arises out of that is:

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.120
why?

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:09.480
I mean, for someone else your parents are the peripheral people, and their parents are central, like

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:14.780
why is it logical that your parents' opinion makes any more difference to you

01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:22.300
than the opinion of some randomly selected people who are approximately that age

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:26.120
why is it the case that you would consider that they know more than someone else?

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:31.120
I mean, I know that they know you better, and fair enough, but that's not the point

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:36.320
and then another point there is that to the degree that your parents' opinion about you matters more

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:41.920
than some randomly selected people of approximately the same age, Jung would say, well

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:49.900
you haven't exactly separated out the God-image from your parents, and so you're still under that combination

01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:55.540
it's like... it's a complicated thing to talk about, but think about the Harry Potter series

01:18:55.540 --> 01:19:02.420
Harry has two sets of parents, right, he's got the Dursley parents, and then he's got these, like, magical parents that sort of float behind

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:07.380
and he should know the difference between them, they shouldn't be one and the same, they're not - for him

01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:11.800
it's like, well, you have your parents and you have nature and culture as parents

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:17.620
and you shouldn't be thinking that your parents are nature and culture as well, they shouldn't have final dominion over you

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:20.500
it means that you're not an individual yet if that's the case

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:26.860
Freud said for example that no one could be a man unless his father had died

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:31.100
and Jung said yes, but that death can take place symbolically

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:36.240
ok, so there's that part of the idea, and then another part of the idea is

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.580
one of the times in your life when you actually realize that you're an individual

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:46.480
is when you'll go and ask your parents something, and you'll realize they actually don't know any more about

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:50.580
what you should do than you do, and that sucks

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:56.460
and that's partly why people are often willing to maintain a tyrant-slave relationship with their father; it's like

01:19:56.460 --> 01:20:03.240
on the one hand you have to be inferior in a relationship like that, you know, you've always got the judge watching you

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:06.620
but on the other hand there's always someone who knows what to do

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:11.580
there's always someone standing between you and the unknown that you can go ask: what should I do?

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:18.100
well, at some point you'll realize that the reason you can't ask that anymore is because they actually don't know any more than you do

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:21.860
and then that's a pain, that is a symbolic death

01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:26.380
that's also when you establish a more individual relationship with your parents

01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:31.020
it's at that point that you can conceivably start taking care of them instead of the reverse

01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:35.780
and that's a time that should come, but you have to let that image of perfection go

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:37.780
and that exposes you

01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:41.580
well, that's what happens here, you know, Pinokio goes home

01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:44.580
and he wants things to be the way they were

01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:48.840
and he wants to stay under the careful care of the benevolent father

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:55.240
but that's no longer possible, he's passed that point, and that's why the father has disappeared

01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:01.260
and so, Gepetto has gone off to look for Pinokio, because he also needs a son

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:04.380
but in any case, the house is abandoned

01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:10.820
and so then we see inside the house that everything's covered in cobwebs, and everything's gone

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:15.980
and Pinokio and the Cricket sit on the steps and they're very concerned; first of all they wonder where he went

01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:21.640
so they're actually concerned that he's gone, but they also don't know what to do, because there's just no going home

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:27.700
and so, you know, that's also the case that once you hit a certain point in your development...

01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:34.000
well, it's the same thing we already talked about, the answers that you are looking for are not going to be found in your parents' house

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:40.460
it's as simple as that, now you could artificially maintain your dependency, but, you know

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:46.060
if you do that for too long, things get pretty ugly, so you get pretty stale, and

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:49.700
you know, you're like bread that's been on the shelf for too long

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:53.220
so, now they're wondering what to do, and where he could be

01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:59.300
and then something very strange happens, the star shows up again, and it turns into a dove

01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:12.740
and the dove flies down and puts a piece of paper bathed in light with gold writing on it in front of the Cricket and the puppet

01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:18.140
so what in the world is going on there? well, we know what the star is, we've seen it multiple times, right

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:27.620
it's also the place that the blue fairy came from, but it's this transcendent place, it's this place that occurs sort of as this ultimate ideal

01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:35.860
and this time it delivers a message; so what's happening here is that...

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:41.040
Pinokio is fundamentally oriented by the wish that his father made so long ago, right?

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:47.740
and the wish was that he would become a fully functioning individual; and so that's that transcendent place

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:53.160
and Jung would say...

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:58.340
when you orient your vision, different things appear to you in the world

01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:04.900
so, and I mean this literally, so, because you can't see everything -

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:11.580
you vision calculates what's necessary, your brain calculates what's necessary for you to see so that you get to the point that you're aiming at

01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:16.520
and I don't mean that metaphorically, I mean it literally

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:23.580
things that aren't relevant to what you're seeking, you won't see them

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:31.360
unless they get in your way, and they have to really block your pathway before they will be literally visible

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:40.280
so you orient yourself towards something, and that makes some things visible that wouldn't be visible and makes others invisible that you might have seen

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:45.820
and so when you change your orientation, what manifests itself in the world also changes

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:54.340
now, Pinokio is in despair here, and he asks himself: where could my father have gone?

01:23:54.340 --> 01:24:00.220
and so, the question is: what exactly is he asking under those circumstances?

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:10.920
and what he's asking is something like: I had a structure that was orienting me properly in relationship to the world

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:17.020
and as far as it was embodied in my actual father it's now gone

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:21.660
is there any possibility that I can find that again?

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:27.720
and that is what you want, you see, like if you're in a chaotic circumstance, maybe you've escaped, let's say, from a bad relationship

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.860
or something like that, and you're out of it, but now you don't know what to do

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:37.580
what you're hoping is that you can get your life back together, right?

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:41.120
that you can put the pieces that have fallen apart back together

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:46.560
and so you're automatically going to generate a fantasy about producing another, let's call it stable state

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:51.300
you're gonna be looking for the spirit that yould enable that state to be generated

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:55.320
'cause really what it is in some sense is your new personality

01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:02.160
you're in chaos, you have to become something new in order to get out of chaos, and so you're hoping for that, you're hoping that you'll see it

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:11.280
and so, that's going to make certain things visible to you, that's the proper way of thinking about it

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:16.820
you know, when you get curious about something, maybe you're curious about something and you walk into a bookstore

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:20.720
that curiosity is going to guide you to a certain set of books

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:26.060
the fact that you have a question in mind is going to open your eyes to certain kinds of possibilities

01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:32.600
and so if your goal is to reestablish your union with the positive father, let's say

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:38.060
then certain things are gonna appear, and other things aren't, and that's what this represents

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:43.280
the transcendent star is the goal, which is this developmental process

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:49.400
it's capable of, let's say, delivering a message to you; in some sense that's what's happening when you're thinking

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:54.320
you know, because you have a problem you wanna solve, you have somewhere you wanna go with your thoughts

01:25:54.320 --> 01:26:01.020
and as a consequence of that information reveals itself to you in the interior landscape

01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:06.200
it's a very strange thing; you know, in some sense it feels as though you're producing the thoughts, but

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:11.140
it could equally be said that you're watching the thoughts reveal themselves

01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:17.100
and which of those is more accurate is by no means obvious; you can certainly have thoughts that surprise you

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:21.840
which is very strange, it's like,  they're your thoughts. How in the world can they surprise you, but they do

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.940
so, it's like you didn't know them before you thought them up and then the question is well where did they come from

01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:28.940
if you didn't know them before you thought them up?

01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:30.940
Well, they sort of spring out of the void.

01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:35.280
That's one way of thinking about it. Anyways...

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:41.680
this is a Holy Ghost symbol, this dove, as well, so that puts some Christian imagery in here again

01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:48.240
You could think of it as a manifestation of the spirit of transformation.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:53.560
That's another way of looking at it. Anyways, it's the conscience that interprets the letter

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:57.960
figuring out what the next thing should be, and weirdly enough, what the letter says is that

01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:04.060
Geppetto was out looking for Pinocchio and he got swallowed by a whale

01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:09.340
which makes very little sense to put it bluntly

01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:16.860
Geppetto went to search for Pinocchio and now he's at the bottom of the sea in a giant whale.

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:22.560
We leap right over that tremendous gap in logic

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:27.360
and follow the story nonetheless. Okay, so what's the idea here?

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:32.660
The idea is that if you fall into a chaotic state and everything falls apart...

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:41.880
there's the possibility that things can come back together

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:47.340
including what you've just learned, in a new state.

01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:52.580
And  so you can conceptualize that symbolically as

01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:58.040
the existence of the dead father at the bottom of the chaotic landscape

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:01.960
That's the proper way, as far as I can tell, to think about it.

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:07.280
It's like there's something down there that's capable of re-forming and reemerging that's

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:12.340
that incorporates the previous state but that takes it farther.

01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:16.400
And you're not going to find that unless you descend into this chaotic place where

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.960
it feels like all order is gone.

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.320
well, you generate order, it's going to be akin to the order that you had before

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:26.840
but there's going to be something new about it as well, so it's down to the bottom of the chaotic state,

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:30.600
to bring up what you're missing.

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:36.040
And, that's one level of analysis. Another level of analysis you think is well that's also what you're doing

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:40.520
that's what you should be doing, in principle, when you're going to university

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:44.640
You know, you're...you come to university

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:47.420
in roughly the same state as Pinocchio.

01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:51.580
You know, you're a bit of a puppet, and you're kind of a jackass, and what the hell do you know?

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:55.360
And it's chaotic because you haven't found your place in the world properly.

01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:00.360
And I don't mean merely for career, not that that's not relevant, because it is,

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:03.860
but it's more important than that. It's because you're a historical creature.

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:07.960
Because, you are a product of history, unless you

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:13.020
are encultureated properly, which means you understand

01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:18.600
your past, in the sense that the humanities can allow for that, then

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:24.320
you haven't been able to incorporate

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:29.100
the wisdom of your ancestors into your day to day pursuits, and that's going to make you weak,

01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:32.580
that's the idea anyways. And so when you come to university,

01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:38.420
this is what university is for. It's so that you can go into the chaos,

01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:42.340
and you can pull something out of it that's truly of value.

01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:46.480
and you can incorporate that in your own personality, and that makes you much, much

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:51.200
stronger, like literally stronger, not more educated, but

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.800
not, it's not like you know more facts,

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:57.360
it's that you literally are a better person, and "better" means

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.240
you can do far more things. You can articulate your - that's something that's of crucial importance is that

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.900
you can articulate yourself properly, which is

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:09.880
more useful than anything else you can possibly manage, like if you guys come out of university

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:13.200
capable of making coherent

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:16.180
arguments, and using language properly,

01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:22.900
you're so powerful that it's ridiculous. You always

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:26.160
you can lay out a strategy and pursue it successfully

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:30.660
and maybe the strategy is oriented towards something good, something that will actually work

01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:33.160
work for you, and work for other people as well

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:37.900
and I don't really understand why people aren't told this when they come to university, is that

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:46.820
your goal is to make yourself as articulate in writing and thinking and speaking as you possibly can

01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:52.960
because that opens the door to everything that you'll wanna do in the future, no matter what it is

01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:59.280
the more articulate person always rises, always

01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:08.220
because they lay out strategies more effectively, they lay out the reasons for doing something or for not doing something

01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:17.740
more particularly; they convince people, and properly so, that they can grapple with potential that lies ahead

01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:23.340
effectively; and they can defend themselves when they're challenged

01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:30.240
and so, all of that is going into the past, into the chaos of the past, you could even say

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:35.700
and pulling up the spirit that inhabits that from the bottom and uniting with it

01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:45.560
and if you don't do that, well, you're defenceless in the case of... in the face of the tragedy of life

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:52.020
and then, that's not so good, because if you're defenceless in the face of the tragedy of life

01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:56.800
then you get way more hurt than you would otherwise get, and so will the people around you; and then

01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:01.380
the probability that you're gonna be resentful and bitter about that is really high, because

01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:07.240
no one likes to fail continually; and then you get bitter and resentful

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:13.280
and then once you're bitter and resentful, well, being vengeful and mean is the next step

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:18.840
it doesn't take much of a transformation to move from that place to the next

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:24.700
so now Pinokio has to face the thing that he's afraid of most

01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:31.340
and that's a complicated idea as well; so Jung had this

01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:36.480
phrase that he took from the alchemists, which was "in sterqualinas invenetur"

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:42.080
and what it meant was: "what you most wanna find will be found where you least wanna look"

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:46.900
there's this old story that's from King Arthur, and King Arthur has these knights, right

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:51.300
they all sit around the Round Table, which means they're roughly equal, that's what the round table means

01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:56.600
and they're off to find the Holy Grail, and the Holy Grail is the most valuable object, that's what it means

01:32:56.600 --> 01:33:01.380
so they're off to find the most valuable thing, but they don't know what it is, and they don't know where it is

01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:06.920
but they know that there's a most valuable thing, so in osme sense it's akin to them orienting themselves by the star

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:12.120
and they don't know where to look, and so what they decide is

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:17.440
they have the castle and it's in the middle of a forest; so each knight decides to start looking for the Holy Grail

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:22.220
by entering the forest at the point that looks darkest to him

01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:27.060
and so what's the idea there?

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:32.240
well, imagine there are things that come easy to you and that you're fond of pursuing

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:36.680
and that you're happy about pursuing; so you've found them and pursued them

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:43.420
and you've mastered them, so you know all that; but then there's another place that you don't wanna go

01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:46.920
and so you haven't gone there and you haven't mastered it, and

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:52.960
you're very small in comparison to it, because you haven't mastered it, and so it has this monstrous aspect

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:57.040
...

01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:03.640
but if what you're doing isn't working, it's where you haven't gone that you need to go

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:07.380
and so, I can give you another example of this, so let's say

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:13.500
you're an agreeable person, and so you don't like conflict and you won't stand up for yourself

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:21.280
and you regard anger and the proclivity to provoke and to engage in conflict as something that's positively terrible

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:25.780
it's not only that you're not good at it, it's actually that it's wrong

01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:29.440
so that's where you have to go if you're gonna learn how to stand up for yourself

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:33.760
and imagine that you're afraid, maybe you have something like agoraphobia

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:38.300
so there's a whole bunch of things that you're afraid of, and you don't wanna go there

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:42.340
but if you wanna put yourself together, then that's exactly where you have to go

01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:51.100
and so it's frequently the case that what you wanna find is to be found where you least wanna find it

01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:57.560
and that idea's echoed in the prominent stories of dragons and gold

01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:05.320
it's exactly the same idea, is that the dragon is this terrible thing, it's this terrible predatory thing that lives forever and is very, very wise

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:10.520
and lives underground, and it'll kill you, it'll burn you up in a second

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:16.860
but it hoards gold; and so you have to go there, into the dragon's lair if you're gonna get the gold

01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:22.160
and that's a representation of peoples' paradoxical relationship with reliaty, it's like

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:27.220
you have to go out there and confront it in order to incorporate what it has to offer to you

01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:33.380
but the probability that that's going to be intensely dangerous and push you right to the limit...

01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:40.360
first of all, those are actually the same thing; if it didn't push you to the limit, you wouldn't gain anything valuable from it

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:45.400
so you don't get one without the other, you don't get the gold without the dragon

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:51.180
that's a very strange, very very strange idea, but it seems to be accurate

01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:56.280
so all of that's lurking underneath this in this imagery of the whale

01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:03.080
the thing that's at the bottom of... now, the whale, you can think of the story of Jonah

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:09.040
what happens with Jonah is that, roughly speaking, he is a prophet

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:15.160
and God tells him that he has to, if I rmember correctly, God tells him that he has to go to this city, and

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:21.400
straighten it out, because it's veered off the path and it's heading towards doom, and

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:27.140
Jonah thinks: I'm not going to that city to tell those people anything like that, because they're not gonna be very happy

01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:31.300
with me just showing up there and telling them, you know, everything they're doing is wrong, and so

01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:39.040
he hops on a boat and tries to get out of there, and then God conjures up this huge storm, and the boat is about to be swamped

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:45.240
and the sailors, they're worried, I think, about making the boat lighter, something like that

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:51.060
they all draw lots to see who gets tossed overboard, and Jonah admits that it's actually his fault

01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:56.880
because God's upset with him, because he got this direct command to go straighten out this city and he ran off, and so

01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.840
the sailors throw... they're not happy about this, but they throw Jonah overboard, and the seas calm

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:06.080
and a great fish comes up, a whale, and swallows him, and then he's down in the fish for three days

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:11.880
and it throws him up on the dry land, and then he's learned his lesson by that time, and he goes off to have this...

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:19.260
to pursue his proper destiny; so that's echoed in this story as well

01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:25.560
that if you don't follow the pathway that you're supposed to follow

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:31.960
the seas will become stormy for you, and something will come up and pull you down

01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:36.100
and you'll be in a terrible place for some length of time, 'till you learn your lesson

01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:41.700
and if you're lucky, you'll get spit back up on shore, and then you can go do what you should do

01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:48.160
well, I mean that's not a lesson that anybody needs to have interpreted, I think everybody understands that

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:54.340
anyways, the Cricket tells Pinokio what he has to do

01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:59.120
and then something kind of paradoxical happens, Pinokio decides he's gonna go do this

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:04.320
and then the Cricket has got this weird, paradoxical response to that; on the one hand he's

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:09.800
he's sort of pulling Pinokio back, saying: look, you know, this is foolhardy

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:14.760
you're gonna go all the way down to the ocean, you're gonna confront this terrible whale, this is really, really dangerous

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:22.180
but at the same time, when Pinokio's on the edge of the cliff, the Cricket helps him tie his tail around a rock

01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:29.140
and he holds his finger in place, so that Pinokio can tie the knot, it's like the conscience is conflicted about this

01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:34.120
really dangerous and foolhardy, but it's also necessary, and so he plays this dual role

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:41.540
and Pinokio's leading at this point; so into the ocean he goes

01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:48.040
I guess partly what this means is that if you're not oriented properly in the world, you should take your...

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:52.080
you should take your doubts and the chaos that you're enveloped in seriously

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:55.780
you should face it and think it through, you should go into it as far as you can go into it

01:38:55.780 --> 01:39:04.380
because you'll find something at the bottom of it; the alternative is to pretend that it doesn't exist

01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:12.240
so then Pinokio is at the bottom of the water; he can actually breathe down there, it turns out, so

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:16.780
you could think that he's gone into the unknown, he's outside of dry land,

01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:22.400
he's in the unconscious, all of those things are true, and

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:28.880
you might think, well, why would it be the world outside of what's known and the unconscious at the same time?

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:34.460
this weird intermingling of those two things; and as far as I can tell, that's because

01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:39.880
when you're in chaos and you don't know what's going on, then you start imagining what might be going on

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:44.120
and that imagination is partly the world as it might be

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:49.800
but it's also partly the structure of your unconscious mind, which is producing the fantasies, and so

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:54.420
when you're truly in chaos, then the distinction between your fantasies and reality isn't clear

01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:59.640
that's actually what constitutes the chaos; so imagine this, so

01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:03.400
you're in a relationship, and the person betrays you

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:07.620
and you knew who they were, at least you thought you did, before that moment

01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:12.200
but now you're looking at them and you don't know who they are

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:15.820
and you don't know what the past was, and you don't know what the present is

01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:20.520
and you don't know what the future's going to be; all of that's been thrown up into the air in a major way

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:24.620
that's traumatic, so much has fallen apart that it's traumatic

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:29.780
so what do you start to do? you start to imagine what might be the situation

01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:34.600
well, then the reality, like, the reality is the reality and your imagination at the same time

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:42.160
they're not pulled apart at all, you cannot distinguish between them, and so

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:48.680
it was a Jungian idea... I could say that's the snitch that Harry Potter's chasing, by the way

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:56.420
I know that's a terrible leap, but that is what it is, it's that weird intermingling of potential and reality that

01:40:56.420 --> 01:41:03.500
that can manifest itself as the world if you pursue it, it's roughly that

01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:09.300
so Pinokio's in this situation that's half-fantasy and half-reality, in this chaotic state

01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:13.080
and he has to go down to find the thing that he least wants to find

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:20.420
and he's hoping that it... he's got this intuition that in facing that thing, that chaos that life really is, that chaos

01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:28.460
that he's going to find his father and reunite with him

01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:35.340
so you could also say that in some sense it's a decision of faith, i suppose, because

01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:43.020
you might ask yourself, well, why bother confronting chaos? if chaos is the ultimate reality, then what the hell use is facing it?

01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:47.260
because it's just gonna reveal itself as the ultimate reality and drown you

01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:52.000
but the myths always say the same thing, they say: "no, no, if you confront what's really disturbing you

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.740
if you really confront it, and you do it voluntarily, you're gonna find order in it eventually"

01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:59.380
or at least that's the only way you're gonna find order

01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:05.160
now, it's not like these stories are optimistic, and it's not as if they give you a sure guide to success

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:09.180
that's the other thing, it's not like they're unerringly accurate, because

01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:17.100
you can be subsumed by chaos that's so total that even if you face it, you're not gonna prevail

01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:21.980
I mean, that's why people die, that's one way of looking at it anyways

01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:25.700
but the mythology basically says that this is your best bet

01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:30.600
if there's a process that's going to work, this is it

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:35.740
and so, and then you might think, well, the better you do it, the better the chances are of success

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:39.860
or the more consistently you do it, the better the chances of success are

01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:42.400
and I think that that's a perfectly reasonable way of looking at it

01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.960
ok, so anyways, Pinokio's down at the bottom of the ocean

01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:51.320
and every time he says... he's trying  to find out where Monstro is

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:58.020
and they ask questions to the fish down there, but every time they mention Monstro's name, all the fish disappear

01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:02.040
that's like Voldemort, right? he's the guy whose name you cannot say

01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:08.640
and Monstro is precisely that, it's the thing that frightens everyone, and so

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:16.480
asking questions down there isn't helping very much, and so Pinokio, what he does is he's calling for his father, and he keeps going deeper and deeper into the depths

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:21.700
and there's a scene where

01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:27.320
the darkness of the ocean turns into an even more profound darkness, and that's what Pinokio disappears into

01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:34.680
and then we see Monstro, he's in this sort of foggy representation, this huge thing that lies very much at the bottom

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:40.940
and there's no life or anything around him except, I think these are mackerel, but maybe they're tuna

01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:43.700
they're animated anyway, so it doesn't matter

01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:49.100
but there's no life down there, he's so far down at the bottom of the ocean that there's nothing that's alive down there

01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:53.180
so, and then we go inside the whale, which is, of course, abzurd

01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:58.220
we see that the whale has eaten a boat at some point in the past, this is one whopping whale

01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:02.080
and Gepetto is sitting with the kitten, of all things,

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:06.880
he's also got that litte goldfish bowl full of goldfish with him too, which is quite the feat

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:13.140
anyways, he's sitting there and he knows that he's trapped in the belly of the whale too, and that he can't get out

01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:19.320
and so that's an interesting issue, because it's not only Pinokio is lacking his father, which isn't a good thing

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:26.000
but the father is lacking the son, and there's some indication that the father can't get out of the whale without the son

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.860
and so it's like the possibility for order is down there in this chaotic state

01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:39.000
but unless there's an active agent to go seek it out, it can't pull itself... it's not animated enough to get out by itself

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.980
you know, and you could say, well, there's wisdom in the libraries, but it's not going to..

01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:51.060
without you going in there and gathering it, and embodying it, all it does is sit there in potential in all of that...

01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:54.520
imlicit form, that's a good way of thinking about it

01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:58.160
so anyways, Gepetto is feeling pretty hopeless

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:02.180
because he can't figure out any way of getting out of the whale, and he's also starving

01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:06.300
he's starving in the belly of the whale

01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:13.180
here's a way of thinking about that:

01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:16.900
Gepetto's a good guy, but he's old

01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:21.920
and that means his way of doing things is no longer fruitful, that's why he's starving

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:25.640
and it's especially not fruitful, 'cause he's missing his son

01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:31.640
he's missing the active element that the child represents, say, the playful and transformative element that the child represents

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:36.560
and so, if you get stuck doing something the same old way, at some point it's no longer going to work

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:39.960
even if it was good at some point; it has to be updated

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:45.720
and it's updated by, let's call it the spirit of youth, or the spirit of attention, or the spirit of play, something like that

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:51.700
the willingness to break boundaries and take risks; and Gepetto is very, very skilled, but

01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:55.460
but he doesn't have that, and that's symbolized by the loss of his son

01:45:55.460 --> 01:46:00.880
that's why he was out looking for his son too, he needs him; and so, they're in despair down there

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:04.880
trying to fish and not getting anything, and so...

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:08.700
Monstro wakes up

01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:13.900
a mackerel happens to swim by and Monstro wakes up, and so...

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:17.780
I think they're tuna, actually, they look like tuna to me

01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:23.160
and so, Monstro wakes up and he opens his mouth, and a bunch of water starts to come in

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:30.740
and so, and then you see Pinokio with the fish, now...

01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:35.660
there's very intense implicit Christian symbolism in this part of the film

01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:39.400
and I'm gonna lay it out point by point, so

01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:43.000
you may remember and perhaps you don't, and perhaps you don't know, that

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.680
one of the symbols for Christ is a fish, ichthys, right?

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:52.000
and that's a play on the Greek representation of Christ's name, buyt there's more to it than that, because

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.100
all of Christ's followers are fishermen

01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:59.100
and he performs a bunch of miracles with fish; and fish are strange things

01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:02.540
because, well, you can pull then up out of the depths, that's part of it

01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:08.100
and so they're things that can be pulled out of the depth; and you could say that...

01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:14.300
it's going to be very difficult for me to take this apart, but you can say in some sense that Christ is a meta-fish

01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:18.780
a fish is something that you can dine on

01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:25.420
but a way of being is something that provides you with something to dine on on a continual basis

01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:30.500
and so, you might say, well, is it better to have a fish or to be a fisherman?

01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:35.480
that's another way of thinking about it, and obviously it's better to be a fisherman, because then you can get more fish

01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:43.440
and so, it's one thing to have something, but it's another thing completely to know how to generate good things

01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:48.040
and so, if you had any sense, you'd take the latter over the former

01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:53.700
even though the former is more instantaneously gratifying and requires less work and responsibility

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:58.820
and so, anyways, the whale opens his mouth and goes chasing these fish

01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:03.420
and Pinokio tries... he's trying to get the hell out of there, even though he wants to find the whale

01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:05.800
when he actually sees the whale, he leaves

01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:13.320
and that's also a very common mythological, umm, what would you call it? plot element

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:18.260
it's very frequently that what happens when the hero first sees the terrible thing, the dragon, say

01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:22.400
the terrible thing that he's come to conquer he freezes and gets the hell out of there, because

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:27.520
it's far worse than he thought it was going to be; and so Pinokio is like: no way, man

01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:33.480
I'm not going near that whale; and away he swims, and he's actually at the forefront of all the fish, which is quite interesting too

01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:41.320
so, in the mean time Monstro has opened his mouth, and the fish are pouring in, and Gepetto is fishing like mad, and he's catching fish

01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:45.420
like crazy; and so, the little cat is...

01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:49.340
Gepetto is flinging the fish backwards into this, like, box

01:48:49.340 --> 01:48:54.960
and the little cat is there, whacking them to kill them while they're flopping around

01:48:54.960 --> 01:49:00.800
and so they're pretty excited about this, because... they have a problem, the problem is how to get out of the whale

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:06.080
that's the actual problem; but a nested problem inside that is how not to starve to death

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:11.920
and so, Gepetto's pretty happy that even though he's not getting out of the whale, that he gets to have something to eat

01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:16.000
so you could say as well, that he's not exactly focused on the right thing

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.940
he's focused on the micro-problem instead of the macro-problem, and that makes him kind of blind

01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:27.180
so anyways, the whale swallows up Pinokio, and

01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:31.700
Gepetto keeps fishing; and then he snags Pinokio

01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:37.600
now this is cool, because... and this is another example of that meta-fish idea

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:44.120
it's like... Gepetto's actually looking not for a fish, he's looking for a way out of the damn whale

01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:47.880
and then he catches a bunch of fish, and he's like focused on that like mad

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:52.360
and then he catches Pinokio, and Pinokio represents what would get him out of the whale

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:56.260
but he's so bloody obsessed with the fish tha he doesn't even notice

01:49:56.260 --> 01:49:59.240
so he catches Pinokio and flings him into the fish basket

01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:04.100
and so, it signifies the blindness of Gepetto's orientation

01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:11.540
when he's inside the whale, that's kind of a comment on his aged and insufficient nature

01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:15.640
he's solving the wrong... he's solving the problem very well, but it's the wrong problem

01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:19.940
so anyways, he fires Pinokio into the fish bin, and

01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:28.780
Pinokio says: Father! I'm here; and Gepetto says: Don't bother me right now, Pinokio, I'm busy fishing

01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:34.580
well then, that's fine, so then he kinda wakes up, he has this little moment of insight, this little revelation, that

01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:39.780
well, he's caught Pinokio, so who cares about the damn fish; so then he runs over to the fish box to grab Pinokio

01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:42.700
and instead he grabs a fish, and gives it a kiss

01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:45.600
and so that is another way of hammering home the fact that he's...

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:48.380
there's this confusion that he's suffering from

01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:53.820
he can't distinguish the local truth from the transcendent truth

01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:58.860
and so anyways, he does figure it out; he tosses the fish aside and he grabs Pinokio

01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:02.920
they're all thriled to death to see each other, and so they're united

01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:07.500
so Pinokio has found his father, but they're still trapped in the belly of the whale; now

01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:12.200
Pinokio takes off his hat, he gets covered with a blanket, he takes off his hat, and

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:15.440
he reveals his jackass ears, and so

01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:21.420
he's found his father, but he's damaged, and not... Pinokio, he's damaged and not in good shape

01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:27.980
he isn't becoming what he was supposed to be; in fact, he's actually degenerated since Gepetto saw him last

01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:31.700
and so, he becomes embarrassed, and he says he has a tail

01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:35.840
he says: that's nothing, I have a tail too, and then he spins that around kinda laughing

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:40.040
and he brays and gets really embarrassed, and so, that's what you see here, he looks like, well...

01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:44.220
he's revealed himself as a jackass to his father

01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:50.040
but you know, that's actually a good thing, because...

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:58.680
he is a jackass, and if he was unwilling to admit his insufficiency

01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:06.840
he wouldn't have ever gone on this pursuit, so...

01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:13.060
it's this perverse willingness to note that he isn't all that he could be

01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:17.220
that's part of what drives him to find everything that his father represents

01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:22.840
it's a humility, and it's an admission of insufficiency

01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:27.560
and you need that before you're going to learn anything, because before you learn anything you have to

01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:32.480
admit that there are things that are important that you don't know, and that you're a fool

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:35.360
and maybe that you're a braying jackass

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:39.980
and so, that's why there are injunctions in many religious in many religious writings

01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:45.380
that positively portray humility, as the antidote to arrogance

01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:51.120
that's the right way of thinking about it, is that humility means: I still have something to learn

01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:53.760
I'm insufficient, I still have something to learn

01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:57.220
it's exactly the opposite, say of Lampwick's attitude

01:52:57.220 --> 01:53:03.800
anyways, Gepetto decides that son puppet who's half-jackass is better than no son at all

01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:08.560
which is another indication of his relatively positive orientation towards the world

01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:11.460
and they reunite; and then

01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:17.260
Pinokio immediately sets his eyes on the main problem, it's like: hey, we're stuck in this whale, we need to get out of here!

01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:22.100
and it turns out that Geppetto has already built a raft, but there's a problem, and the problem is that

01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:26.600
as Gepetto says... Pinokio says: well, we'll wait for his mouth to open

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:33.480
and Gepetto says: that doesn't work, because when he opens his mouth, Monstro opens his mouth, everything comes in, and nothing goes out

01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:36.800
so, raft - fine, but there's no way of using it

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:41.360
and so, Gepetto decides that they're not going to bother with that problem

01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:44.840
and they're gonna go have some fish

01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:49.740
but Pinokio, his eyes is still on the main prize, he thinks: no way, man, we're getting out of this whale

01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:54.480
that's the fundamental think, we're not going to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic

01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:59.200
we're going to attend to the fact that it's sinking, we're gonna keep our eye on the primary problem

01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:02.920
so he's a little more awake by now; so Pinokio says:

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:06.900
we'll make a fire; now that's cool, I think, because

01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:11.600
he's down in chaos, where his father is trapped, and the first thing he does is to use fire

01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:15.700
and of course that's exactly what people do, right, 'cause we're fire-users; and so

01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:22.840
and shaman, for example, are masters of fire; but there's this really primordial element to this story right here, and

01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:30.720
it's an indication that the thing that can transform chaos into productive order

01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:33.200
is also the same spirit that mastered fire

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:37.080
and so, Pinokio lays that out; and he says: we're gonna build a fire!

01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:41.160
and we'll fill him up with smoke!

01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:45.040
and Gepetto says: great, smoked fish!

01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:47.420
so he's still stuck on this whole fish thing

01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:52.260
and so Pinokio runs around gathering up all the spare wood on the boat

01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:55.900
including the furniture, which he starts to break; and Gepetto says:

01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:59.020
well, what are we going to sit on? you know, while we eat our smoked fish

01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:04.900
and Pinokio basically says, politely: you know, enough with the damn fish thing

01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:11.280
I'm going to fill the whale with smoke, and that's gonna make him sneeze, and then we can get the hell out of here

01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:16.900
and Gepetto says: that's gonna make him mad, it's not a good idea

01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:24.060
and, well, I would say that that's the stance of the benevolent state against innovation

01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:28.460
you know, even if the innovation is positive, and even if it's transformative and freeing

01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:32.480
the old state, even if it's good, it's going to stand in opposition to that

01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:36.680
and so that's also something that's very useful to know, because otherwise you can get bitter about that

01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:40.380
anyways, Pinokio makes this big fire, Gepetto's pretty worried about it

01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:45.620
and he starts to fill the whale up with smoke; and so this is where the whale turns into a fire-breathing dragon

01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:52.860
which is quite cool, it's like in Sleeping Beauty, Maleficent turns into a fire-spewing dragon as well

01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:57.880
and if you watch the Little Mermaid, that... what's her name? Ursula

01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:03.020
she turns into a gigantic snake-like creature as well, although she doesn't exactly spew fire

01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:10.040
but the transformation of the ultimate monster into something like a dragon is very, very common

01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:14.780
'cause it's the ultimate symbol of the unknown for a variety of reasons that we'll dusciss later

01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:21.660
so anyways... yes, it's a symbol of chaos

01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:27.200
anyways, and this is quite a horrifying scene; when my son watched, and he watched Pinokio when he was about 4

01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:32.660
he watched this scene over, and over, and over; I don't know how many times he watched that movie, but it must've been a hundred times

01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:36.660
but he was really fascinated by this scene

01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:44.200
and you know, he was like locked on to it, it was frightening, but there was something in it that he was processing and catching (?) on to

01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:51.360
so anyways, you see the whale is starting to prepare to sneeze, and he's belching out huge quantities of smoke and fire

01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:59.440
and Pinokio and Gepetto and the cat and the goldfish bowl are all on the raft

01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:05.440
trying desperately to get out of the whale, which inhales and pulls them back, and then sneezes and pushes them forward

01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:11.140
and at some point they actually break free, and there's a 'gates of hell' image there with the whale

01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:15.220
belching out smoke like mad and  its jaws open

01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:19.860
so they're paddling madly away, to get away from this whale

01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:24.300
and the whale is very angry, just as Gepetto suggested

01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:28.360
and there's interesting sound effects that go along with this

01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:33.600
the whale actually turns into a...

01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:36.780
that's what happens when your phone is smarter than you are

01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:40.100
the whale actually turns into into something that's like a locomotive

01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:47.020
and the sound effects become industrial; so it's this monstrous, machine-like locomotive dragon

01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:52.460
that's bent on the destruction of Pinokio

01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:57.400
and you could say it's an amalgam of natural and social forces, completely unleashed

01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:02.120
everything's unleashed against Pinokio and his father, and so...

01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:06.060
they're having a hell of a time, there's big waves, and they end up...

01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:11.640
the whale actually abandons them, but before he does that, it nails them with its tail, and blows the raft into smithereens

01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:15.780
and so then they'e both in the water, and Gepetto and Pinokio are drowning

01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:22.500
and Gepetto actually goes down for the third time, so to speak; and as he's going down, he says to Pinokio:

01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:25.100
save yourself, save yourself

01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:31.960
and so that's kinda Pinokio's last temptation, because Gepetto's had it, and he could just get to shore on his own

01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:36.040
but he would've abandoned his father; and so that's the thing, is...

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:41.300
and that's one of the issues that this movie grapples with, is: what exactly is your responsibility?

01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:47.680
and you could say: well, it's to save yourself, but the myth that underlies this says: no it's not, that 's not exactly right

01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:53.560
it's to rescue your father from the chatic depths, and integrate with that, and to save both

01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:58.540
and that's your duty to your culture; but more than that, it's also your duty to your soul

01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:03.520
it isn't gonna work, if you just save yourself, 'cause you're still gonna be a jackass puppet

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:06.120
even though you're gonna be back on shore

01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:12.000
so anyways, Pinokio grabs Gepetto and carries him to shore; and the whale shows back up

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.060
and gives them one more good wallop; and then we see everybody on shore

01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:21.360
and it's peaceful again, Gepetto is in his back on the dry land

01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:28.880
and the kitten washes up, and the goldfish bowl washes up, and the cricket washes up, he's been outside the whale all this time

01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:36.260
and we see the Cricket calling for Pinokio, and then we see him lying in a pool of water, dead

01:59:36.260 --> 01:59:39.360
so he's died

01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:41.820
rescuing his father, he died

01:59:41.820 --> 01:59:47.920
well, why? well, he is a jackass puppet, and maybe he was supposed to die if he rescued his father

01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:51.640
because that insufficiency that characterized him

01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:56.160
is something that's descroyed by the process of encountering the chaos

01:59:56.160 --> 01:59:59.460
which was so difficult it reforms the personality

01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:06.820
and the same occurs when he rescues his father and incorporates that, so it's like...

02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:16.080
Bilbo in the first part of the... what is it called? The Lord of the Rings... The Hobbit!

02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:22.320
he's this sort of jackass puppet guy, little overprotected Shire-dweller at the beginning

02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:30.080
and he goes on this tremendous adventure, and he has to develop the negative parts of his character, he actually has to become a professional thief

02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:38.220
and he has to develop his bravery, and... and so the old personality in some sense has to die to give life to the new one

02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:43.760
and so...

02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:47.840
you see in the Harry Potter series, too, at the very end

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:51.760
Potter dies, and then is resurrected, right, that's...

02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:56.220
and that actually happens to a slightly lesser degree in the second movie

02:00:56.220 --> 02:01:02.280
where the resurrection is aided by the phoenix tears, after he gets eaten by the... or he gets chomped by that big snake

02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:05.840
which is, roughly speaking, the same thing that's happening here

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:07.500
sorry about that

02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:10.920
okay, so anyways, Pinokio's dead, that's not good

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:16.220
so, the next scene we see them back at home, and he's lying dead on the bed

02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:21.160
and Gepetto and everyone else are mourning his loss

02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:28.200
and then we see this magic transformation, and we hear the Blue Fairy's voice

02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:35.140
and so, it's like he's pushed himself to his limits, and a natural process kicks back in, and revivifies him

02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:41.580
but now he's no longer a jackass puppet, he's actually something that's real

02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:48.420
and so then he wakes up and he notices that now, you know, he's undergone this proper transformation

02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:50.960
he notices his hands in particular

02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:58.920
and then he tells Gepetto, who refuses to even notice; he says: no, no, kid, you're dead, lie down

02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:03.440
so, you know, Pinokio convinces him that he's not dead, and then

02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:07.900
in celebration they start the clocks again, and so time kicks back in at that point

02:02:07.900 --> 02:02:15.920
and so, then they have a big celebration, music happens again, because this is a celebratory moment

02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:23.300
and they dance, and the harmony's restored, the good old guy has his son, and so

02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:29.120
the house is properly set up, and the old state has its vision, and its capacity for transformation

02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:34.860
and the thing that transforms has the stability of the culture behind it, and so - perfect

02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:42.120
and then the Cricket goes outside, and he's talking to the Start and the Blue Fairy, and he says that he's pretty happy about how this has gone

02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:46.700
and so, then she gives him this little medal

02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:50.680
which is made out of gold, and it's a sun, and it's a mandala, all at the same time

02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:58.420
and it's made out of gold, and gold is a noble metal, it doesn't mate indiscriminately with other metals

02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:06.240
it doesn't tarnish, and so it's a metal that represents the sun; and he flashes his little badge at the Star

02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:14.060
establishing a relationship between his function as the proper conscience and his orientation towards the highest good

02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:19.320
and that's it there, so he's got this little sun, he's wearing his little sun

02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:24.340
so he's also transformed and developed as a consequence of this entire process

02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:28.020
no Pinokio's conscience is properly oriented

02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:34.560
it's oriented towards the highest value; and then the movie closes

02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:39.840
and that's "Pinokio"

02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:58.260
so, I'll give you a minute, and I'll take some questions, and try to figure out how to shut my phone up

02:03:58.260 --> 02:04:03.260
so does anybody have any questions? yes -&gt;

02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:10.600
[student] you seem to have a vaguely psychoanalytic approach to kind of extracting the inarticulated messages

02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:14.800
from the mythologies and the stories and religion that's developed over time

02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:22.760
so could you almost say that those are kind of constructing this to a societal level out of the individual level

02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:25.060
that these are kind of the dreams of the collective unconscious?

02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:28.420
[Peterson] sure, that's exactly what they are

02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:32.860
they're the fantasies of the collective unconscious, that's one way of looking at it

02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:37.700
I mean, they also take a socially determined form

02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:47.400
right, because it's animated, and that's a technology, and it's obviously something that exists in a particular time and place

02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:53.620
but yeah, they're... it's a collective attempt to give voice to the oldest of behavioral patterns

02:04:53.620 --> 02:04:56.880
and so, here's one way of thinking about that

02:04:56.880 --> 02:05:01.500
which we'll talk about in some detail, which you should have read about, at least to some degree, already

02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:05.980
the question is: where is that knowledge represented?

02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:13.620
and Jung would say, well it's part of the collective unconscious, and it's got a biological origin, but

02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:21.100
his description of the biological nature of the collective unconscious is quite ambiguous

02:05:21.100 --> 02:05:24.640
and I think that that's because it actually is ambiguous, like

02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:34.200
for example, we know that primates, and humans in particular, are at least biologically predisposed to be afraid of snakes

02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:41.640
so we can learn that very easily; now, you could make a case that it's more than biological predisposition, and that it's actually built in

02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:49.080
but I would say the predisposition idea is actually a better one, because you at least need the exposure to the snake to get it going

02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:55.360
so that would take place as a consequence of your experience, so it's not purely biological, although

02:05:55.360 --> 02:06:03.320
it is the case that snake fear tends to become more intense as you get older, which is not necessarily what you would expect

02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:09.660
and the... I just read a paper this week, localizing snake fear in primates, and it was hypothalamic

02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:15.360
it's really old, because the hypothalamus is a very old part of the brain, it's older than the amygdala

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:20.140
and the amygdala is involved in snake fear as well, it's really, really old

02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:26.300
so you could say, well, you're prepared to develop snake fear, like you're prepared to develop language

02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:30.260
and like you're prepared to walk by your biological structure

02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:36.820
now, whether that actually  constitutes the contents of your memory, which is what Jung seems to imply

02:06:36.820 --> 02:06:42.240
is an open question, but it doesn't really matter, because...

02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:50.200
so, one time when I went to visit my nephew, he was running around in a knight suit

02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:57.720
he was only about 4 or 5; so he's acting out this mythological pattern, roughly speaking

02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:03.240
and you'd say, well, how did he know how to do that, and the answer would be: well, it was represented all around him in the culture

02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:06.300
in fragments, and like

02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:09.440
kids are pretty good in putting fragments of stories together

02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:14.020
that's really what understanding is, is to put fragments into story form

02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:21.000
and so, he watched Disney movies and his parents had read him storeis, and he did pretend play with the other kids, and

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.040
all of those were like exemplars of this underlying narrative

02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:32.220
they're variants of it; and because he can abstract and generalize, he's pulling out the central features of those narratives

02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:36.540
the heroic features, and then embodying them; so you could say, well

02:07:36.540 --> 02:07:43.620
the central features of these narratives are fragmented and distributed across the entire culture

02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:49.320
and so, they don't have to be exactly inside your head, they don't have to be part of your memory

02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:54.880
they're distributed in the behavior, and the actions, and the stories of the entire culture

02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:58.400
and they just... you can put them together out of that

02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:02.800
so, and people do that, that's why they're so hungry for stories like...

02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:10.660
well, like this one, or like Star Wars, or like Star Trek, or like the Marvel movies, or like Harry Potter

02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:15.100
[student] yeah, what you said about the last scene, your son watching it over and over again

02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:19.640
my little brother did the same thing with the last scene of the first Harry Potter movie, the guy with the two faces?

02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:22.000
he watched that probably 20 or 30 times

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:27.320
yeah, that's really interesting, watching little kids interact... like those movies are unbelievably complex

02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:33.780
I mean, you know, by the time you're your age, and you've seen, you know, several hundred of then at minimum

02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:38.020
the impact wears off, but it's really something, sitting down with a four-year-old

02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:44.220
who hasn't watched very many movies, and walking through one with them, I mean they're so turned on it's just...

02:08:44.220 --> 02:08:49.800
I took my daughter when she was too young, actually... I took her to see "The Mask", the Jim Carrey movie

02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:53.840
Jesus, I mean she survived it, I don't think I traumatized her

02:08:53.840 --> 02:09:00.300
but she was sitting on my lap, and it was really like gripping a bundle of barbed wire

02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:03.780
she was just like that the entire movie, you know

02:09:03.780 --> 02:09:09.360
and half way through I thought: well, that's probably a little too much psychophysiological intensity for one small body

02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:13.780
you know, but she... those movies, they just have a massive impact on little kids

02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:18.960
and they will do exactly that, they'll watch it over and over, and over, and you think: what are they doing exactly?

02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:23.520
they're trying to understand, they're gripped by it somehow

02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:28.480
right, and it's like they're deeply curious, they know there's something in it

02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:34.420
and they're trying to extract out what it is, and they'll repeat it, and repeat it, so...

02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:44.240
they're hungry for the information 'cause it's part of rescuing their father from chaos, that's one way of thinking about it

02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:49.620
other questions?

02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:56.440
well, good enough then, let's call it a day; oh, there is one more question

02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:02.280
[student] so, in Maps of Meaning there is the idea that you keep returning to about

02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:11.240
when you first encounter the unknown it's like, it's first fearful; and then Jung has the idea of archetypes, so

02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:19.320
are there other kinds of meaning that people will find in new information that's already patterned into them?

02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:21.940
[Peterson] that's patterned into them or into the new information?

02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:26.860
[student] that's patterned into them, like ???, do people actually...?

02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:32.460
sure, well, they project the contents of their fantasy onto the unknown thing

02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:37.400
and that's partly a process of self-discovery

02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:45.600
you know, so, for example, let's say that you, you know, you're gripped by love at first sight or something like that

02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:49.440
now, you don't know anything about the person that you're tremendously attracted to

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:52.060
but you'll have fantasies about them

02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:55.960
and that fantasy... in fact, your image of them is a fantasy

02:10:55.960 --> 02:11:02.120
and if you take that fantasy apart, you'll find out what you value

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:06.040
so you are projecting, you're projecting yourself into the world; and you can discover...

02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:11.960
I mean you may also discover something about them, because there may be elements of them that match the ideal quite nicely, if you're fortunate

02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:15.920
and if your ideal is, you know, of a reasonable sort

02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:20.660
but you can... you definitely encounter yourself if you look at the unknown

02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:25.620
because you use your fantasy to structure the contact

02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:30.620
you know, and the fundamental structure is:the heroic encounter with the unknown

02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:38.260
because that's the pathway... that's the fundamental pathway of human beings, 'cause we're information foragers, fundamentally

02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:44.900
[student] so it's that automatic response and the fantasies as well, that are part of the first contact...

02:11:44.900 --> 02:11:51.720
[Peterson] sure, sure, well, that's also... yes, absolutely, that's exactly right, yes, so...

02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:57.240
I mean, imagine this, imagine that you're attracted to someone, and you're just too terrified to go speak to her

02:11:57.240 --> 02:12:02.080
well, what's happening? well, you have a fantasy of a judge

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:08.800
and that's your imagined representation of your own insufficiency in relationship to the ideal

02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:13.700
and you project that on this person as a judge, and then you're too paralyzed to even open your mouth around her

02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:17.160
very common experience

02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:25.260
okay, let's call it a day, we'll see you in a week
