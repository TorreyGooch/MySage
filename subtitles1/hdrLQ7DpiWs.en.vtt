00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.860
Okay, well I thought this time that I would actually

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.040
cover some of the biblical stories.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.300
So, and, hopefully a number of them. Um.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.320
As I said last time, I'm going to go through this,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.120
well, as fast as I am able to,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.320
I want to do as complete a job as possible

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.300
and of course, the probability that I'll get through the entire Bible is very low.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.620
But we'll get through a lot of the major stories in the beginning of it

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.540
and that's a good start.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.440
And then, you know, assuming that this all goes well

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.980
then maybe I'll try to do the same thing again either in the fall or next year.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.860
Assuming everything is still working out properly next year.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.480
It's a long ways away.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.480
Alright, so...

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.520
I guess we'll start.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.680
So, last week I talked to you about a line in the New Testament that was from John,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.260
and it was line that was designed to parallel the opening of Genesis.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.500
And it's a really important line and I thought

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.740
I would reemphasize it.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.698
Because the Bible is a book that's been written

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.080
forward and backwards in time,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.560
in some sense, like most books.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.080
Because if you write a book, of course,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.560
when you get to the end, if you're the writer,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.300
you can adjust the beginning and so on.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.860
So it has this odd appearence of linearity

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.460
but it really isn't linear.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.800
It's like you're God, in some sense,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.460
standing outside of time,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.280
that's your book,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.620
and you can play with time anywhere along it.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.500
And the people who put the books together took full advantage of that,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.180
and that makes the story...

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.380
It gives the story odd parallels in many, many places

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.940
And this is one of the major parallels, at least

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.460
from the perspective of the Christian interpretation of the Bible,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.380
which of course includes the New Testament.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.260
And so, there's this strange idea

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.020
that Christ was the same factor or force

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.920
that God used at the beginning of time to speak habitable order into being.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.080
And that's a very very strange idea,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.880
you know,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.280
it's not something that can be just easily dimissed as superstition

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.940
partly because it's so strange.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.660
It doesn't even fit the definiton of a superstitious belief.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.360
It's a dream-like belief, in some sense,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.680
and what I see many of the ideas in the Bible as

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.680
is these dream-like ideas that

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.900
underlie our normative cognition and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.760
that constitute the ground from which our more

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.940
articulated and explicit ideas have emerged.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.940
And this one idea is so complicated that it's still mostly embedded in dream-like form

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.080
But it seems to have something to do with the primacy of consciousness,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.760
and this is one of the biggest issues regarding the structure of reality,

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.040
as far as I can tell,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.400
because everyone from physicists to neurobiologists debates this.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.920
The stumbling block for a purely objective view of the world seems to me to be consciousness.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.500
And consciousness has all sorts of strange properties, for example:

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.960
it isn't obvious what constitutes time or at least duration in the absence of consciousness.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.320
And it isn't also easy to understand what constitutes Being in the absence of consciousness,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.560
because it seems to be the case...

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.640
Well, if a movie is running, and there's no one to watch it

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.740
- I know it sound like the tree in a forest idea, but it's not that idea at all -

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.600
if a movie is running and no one's watching it,

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.380
then in what sense can you say that there's even a movie running?

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.580
Because the movie seems to be the experience of the movie,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.240
not the objective elements of the movie.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.360
And there's something about the world, at least insofar as we're in it as human beings,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.940
that is dependent on conscious experience of the world.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.540
Now, of course, you can take consciousness out of the world and say:

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.200
well, if none of us were here, if there was no such thing as consciousness,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.920
then the cosmos would continue running the way it is running,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.160
but, of course, it depends on what exactly you mean by the cosmos

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.200
when you make a statement like that,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.356
because there's something about the subjective experience of reality

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.880
that gives it reality.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.240
Or at least that's one way of looking at it.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.360
And since we're all pretty enamored of our own consciousnesses,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.880
although they're painful, because they define our Being,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.860
it's not unreasonable to give consciousness a kind of metaphysical primacy.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.120
And it's a deeper idea than that,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.340
because there are physicists and they're not trivial physicists,

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.620
like John Wheeler,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.080
who believes that in some sense consciousness plays a constitutive role

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.560
in transforming the chaotic potential of being into the actuality of Being.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.220
He actually thinks about it - he's not alive anymore, but

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.980
he actually thought about it as playing a constitutive role.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.540
And then, from the neurobiological perspective,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.660
or from the scientific perspective,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.840
counsciousness is not something we understand,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.100
I don't think we understand it at all.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.720
It's something we can't get a handle on

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.620
with our fundamental materialist philosophy.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.360
And I don't know why that is.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.100
It's quite frustrating if you're a scientist, but it isn't clear to me

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.220
that we've made any progress whatsoever in understanding consciousness,

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.920
even though, well, we've been trying to understand it for hundreds of years

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.920
and even though psychologists and neurobiologists and so forth

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.800
have really put a lot of effort into understanding consciousness from a scientific perspective

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.300
in the last 50 years.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.260
Anyways, what seems to me is the idea

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:57.780
that God used the Word to extract
habitable order out of chaos

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.040
at the beginning of time, which is roughly the right way of thinking about it,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.680
seems to me deeply allied with the idea that

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.900
what it is that we do as human beings is encounter something like a formless and potential chaos,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.580
I mean, we're not omniscient, obviously, and we can't just do whatever we want,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.360
but we encounter a formless and chaotic potential.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.760
That's always what we're grappling with

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.400
and somehow we use our consciousness to give that form,

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.480
and this is how people act.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.740
Like, if you look at how they regard themselves, it's how they act,

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.560
because you say things to people, like: You shoud live up to your potential.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.120
And you make a case that there's something about a person

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.580
that's more than what is, that yet could be,

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.260
if only they participated in the process properly.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.620
And everyone knows what that means, no one acts like a mystery has been uttered

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.960
when you say that.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.320
And you can see a situation in your own life that's full of potential,

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.260
you're often extremely excited when you encounter something that's full of potential

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.040
because what you see is something what could be, you see a future beckoning for you,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.220
that could be if only you interacted with it properly,

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.980
and it activates your nervous system, in a very basic way

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.740
we even understand how that happens, to the degree that we understand how the nervous system works

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.380
because the systems that mediate positive emotion,

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.400
which are governed roughly by the neurochemical dopamine

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.680
and which have their roots way down in the ancient hypothalamus,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.500
a very very archaic and fundamental part of the brain,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:32.020
that responds to potential, which is the possibility of accruing something new and valuable,

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.060
it responds to potential with active movement forward and engagement,

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.540
and so we're engaged in the world that has potential and it looks like consciousness does that.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.300
And so there's this idea that -

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.300
- and this is the main idea that I think is being put forth in Genesis I -

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.520
it's something like -

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.160
and you see this in mythology:

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.920
from what I've been able to gather, there's always three causal elements

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.920
that make up Being at the bottom of world mythology:

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.180
One is the formless potential that makes up Being once it's interacted with,

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.860
and that's generally given a feminine nature,

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.280
and I think that's because it's like the source from which all things emerge and rise.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.500
It's something like that, it's more complicated than that, but it's something like that.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.520
And then there's some kind of interpretive structure

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.220
that has to grapple with that formless potential,

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.020
and I think that's the sort of thing that was alluded to

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.320
by Immanuel Kant when he was criticizing the notion

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.960
that all of our information comes from sense data,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.120
which would be the pure empirical perspective.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.540
Because when you encounter the world,

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.420
you encounter it with that cognitive structure that already has shape,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.180
and so it's already in you, this structure,

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.160
and without that a priori structure you wouldn't be able to

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.740
take the formless potential and give it structure

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.080
and I think that's akin in some way to the idea of God the Father,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.080
and I'll try to develop that idea more,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.080
it's the notion that there's something in all of us,

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.040
that transcends all of us, that's deeply structural,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.240
that's part of this ancient, I would say evolutionary and cultural process,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:11.400
that enables us to grapple with the formless potential and bring forth reality, roughly speaking.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.800
And then there's the final element, and that element seems to be

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.300
something like consciousness itself, the consciousness that actually inheres in the individual,

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:25.440
so it's not only that you have a structure, it's that the structure has the capacity for action in the world.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.620
And it's like...

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.980
You're the spirit that gives the dead structure life, it's something like that.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:37.220
And, as far as I can tell, the triniterian notion that characterizes Christianity

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.360
is something like formless potential, which is never given the status of a deity in Christianity,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.480
and then the notion that there's an a priori interpretive structure

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.240
that's a consequence of our ancient existence as Beings,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.840
it goes back as far in time as you can go, the notion of a structure.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:02.460
And then the idea of a consciousness that is the tool of that structure

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.140
and that interacts with the world and gives it reality.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.920
And that's the Word, as far as I can tell,

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.080
and so the notion is that there's a father - and that's the structure - and that there's a son that's transcendent,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.100
that characterizes consciousness itself,

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:24.060
and that it's the son - the speaking of the son - that is the active principle that turns chaos into order.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.980
That's such a sophisticated idea, as far as I'm concerned,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.720
because while there's something about it at least phenomenologically accurate,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.800
because you do have an interpretive structure and you couldn't understand anything without it,

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:42.980
your very body is an interpretive structure, it's been crafted over, let's say, three billion years of evolution,

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.540
without that, you wouldn't be able to perceive anything

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.380
and it's taken a lot of death and struggle and tragedy to produce

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:55.500
you, the thing that's capable of encountering this immense chaos that surrounds us

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.040
and to transform it into habitable order.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.760
And then there's the idea, too, of course, that's deeply embedded in the first chapters of Genesis,

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.580
which is a staggering idea, you know,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.580
and certainly not one that's likely,

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.640
that human beings were made in the image of God,

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.780
both male and female were made in the image of God,

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.920
and that's of course a very difficult thing to understand,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:22.420
partly because the God that's referred to in those chapters has a kind of polytheistic element

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.380
although it's an element that's moving rapidly towards a unified monotheism,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.320
but it's not also obvious to me why people would come up with that concept,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.760
because I don't really think that when we think about each other we immediately think godlike,

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.100
you know, the notion that every single human being,

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.020
regardless of their peculiarities and strangenesses and sins and crimes and all of that,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.580
has something divine in them that needs to be regarded with respect,

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.460
and that plays an integral role, at least an analogous role,

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.820
in the creation of habitable order out of chaos,

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.100
that's a magnificent, remarkable, crazy idea,

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:06.180
and yet we developed it, and I do firmly believe that it sits at the base of our legal system,

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:10.200
I think it is the cornerstone of our legal system.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.980
That's the notion that everyone is equal before God, which is, of course,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.580
a completely strange idea, it's very difficult to understand

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.580
how anybody could have ever come up with that idea,

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:24.120
because the manifold differences between people are so obvious and so evident

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:30.660
that you could say the natural way of viewing human beings is in this extremely hierarchical manner,

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.500
where some people are contemptible and easily brushed off

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:40.280
as pointless and pathological and without value whatsoever.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.160
And all the power accrues to a certain tiny aristocratic minority at the top.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:51.220
But if you look at the way that the idea of the individual sovereignty developed,

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.700
it's clear that it unfolded over thousands, and perhaps tens of thousands of years

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.740
before it became something firmly fixed in the imagination

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.300
that each individual had something of transcendent value about them,

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.900
and I tell you, we dispense with that idea at our serious peril.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.080
And so, if you're going to take that idea seriously,

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.560
which you do, because you act it out, otherwise you wouldn't be law abiding citizens,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:23.900
you act that idea out, it's firmly shared by everyone who acts in a civilized manner.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.960
The question is: Why in the world do you believe it?

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:32.900
Assuming you believe what you act out, which I think is a really good way of fundamentally defining belief.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:40.040
So that's the sort of ideas, that there's this God of tradition and structure,

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.920
that's God the Father, who uses the Son,

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.860
which is more of an active force, and primarily something that's verbal,

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.840
which I also think is extremely interesting,

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.900
because it's associated not with thought precisely, but with speech,

00:13:53.900 --> 00:14:00.220
and I think the reason for that is that there's something to speech that's more than mere thought,

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.500
and I think part of the reason for that is that speech is a public utterance,

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.600
and, at least in principle,

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.940
speech is something that's shaped by the existence of everyone else, at least across time,

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:18.500
because when you speak, your speech is put forward in the world as a causal element

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:25.200
and it's also subject to criticism and cooperation and mutual shaping,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.880
and so there's an idea here, too,

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:35.260
that the cognitive processes that bring habitable reality out of uninhabitable chaos

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.920
have this collective and public element,

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.920
which is part of the reason, by the way,

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.240
that I'm an advocate of free speech, let's say, above all,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.140
because I don't think, although it is the case,

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.120
for example in the Canadian Bill of Rights,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.820
that every single right has equal value.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.540
That's the theory.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.360
It's an idiotic theory because it's absolutely impossible

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.760
for a large set of rights to have absolutely equal standards and stats.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.420
That cannot happen, there's no way that that can ever work,

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.840
but that is the legal judgement.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:08.540
But I think it's a huge mistake, because free speech has this divine quality, let's say,

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:14.420
that you can't escape from, because it's the thing that manufactures everything else,

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.960
you know, and I do think that the dream

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.180
that you can think of as encapsulated in the stories of Genesis

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:28.980
is the dream by which human beings dreamed up the idea that we would now consider consciousness,

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.980
because it took us a long time to figure out the word consciousness,

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.880
it's not like it's bloody obvious,

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.040
who knows how many thousands of years -

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.240
or who knows what struggles we had to undertake to abstract out something like consciousness,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.320
and how we had to represent that dramatically, say, or symbolically,

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.920
or in a dream-like fashion, before we could actually

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.820
formulate the term and localize that to some degree in people.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.000
It's very sophisticated.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
So John makes the case that,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.340
well, there's an emanation of God or an element of God,

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:08.760
the transcendent consciousness, something like that,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:15.980
that acts directly and in a sort of living way with the underlying potential of the world,

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.780
and I think that that's phenomenologically accurate

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.400
and I do think that that's the way we regard our lives,

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.260
because, you know, when you think about it, too,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.180
we tend to think that what you encounter when you're looking at the world is the material world,

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.660
but that isn't how you act.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.380
You do act as if you're in a place of potential

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.240
and also in a place of potential that you can actually transform,

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.080
which is also something extraordinarily strange, you know,

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.820
because we do treat each other as if we're capable of

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.120
bringing new forms into the world in some permanent manner.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.160
And we treat each other as if we have free choice and free will,

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.600
and perhaps we don't,

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.400
but it's certainly the case that societies that are predicated on the idea that we don't

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.940
don't do very well.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:03.440
And societies that are predicated on the idea that we do seem to do a lot better.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.580
Plus, people tend to get very annoyed at you if you treat them

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.420
like they're automatons that lack free will,

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.060
that's something people find very,

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.740
I would say, constraining, slave-like, about that even.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.200
The demand that you don't have actual autonomy-

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.840
And even worse that you're not responsible for your choices

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.920
It's an insult to someone to suggest to them

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.200
that they're not responsible for their choices.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.720
To do that to someone from a legal perspective you have to argue something like diminished capacity

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.680
Well you're mentally ill or you don't have the intellectual capacity

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.000
Or you were addled by some substance or you had a brain injury or something

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.800
and that's why you're not responsible for your actions

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.000
Otherwise, part of the respect that you give to another human being

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.720
is the assumption that they're responsible for their actions

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.400
And some of that can be if you do something bad then you're responsible for it

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:03.120
But part of that too is if you do something good, you're also responsible for that

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.560
And that also seems necessary because-

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:15.160
I mean, it's gotta be more annoying than anything else you could imagine to strive virtuously

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.960
let's say to produce something of extreme value and then to be treated as if that was a mere deterministic outcome

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.640
and that your actual choices had nothing to do with that

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.040
People find that sort of thing extraordinarily punishing

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.760
I know that there are debates about all these things

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.960
and debates about free will and debates about the nature of consciousness but

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.240
I'm trying to take a clear look at how people act and how they want to be treated

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:47.200
and then trace it back to these old ideas to see if there's some metaphysical connection

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.800
So here's how the book opens

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.080
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.080
The earth was without form and void,

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.560
and darkness was over the face of the deep.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.880
And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:12.840
Now this is a hard - what would you call - narrative section to get a handle on

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.160
Because in order to understand it properly you have to actually look behind it.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:27.880
So there are a lot of pieces of old stories in the Old Testament that flesh out the meaning of these lines

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.120
And I can give you a quick overview of it.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.600
One of the ideas that lurks underneath these lines

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.360
Although you can't tell because it's in English

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.720
You have to look at the original languages

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.320
And of course I don't speak the original languages so I've had to use secondary sources

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.320
Too bad for me

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.640
But the "without form and void and the deep" idea

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:54.960
You see, that's associated with this notion of endless deep potential

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.680
So for example, the words that are used to represent "without form and void"

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.440
Are something like - well one is -

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.360
I'm going to get this partly wrong

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.760
Tohu wa-bohu

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.520
and another one is Taom

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:13.760
and it's important to know this because those words are associated with an earlier Mesopotamian word which is

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:19.520
Tiamat. And Tiamat was a dragon-like creature who represented the salt water

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.880
And Tiamat had a husband named Apsu

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.400
And Tiamat and Apsu were sort of locked together in kind of a sexual embrace

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.960
and it was that locking together of Tiamat and Apsu

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.680
and I would say that's potential and order- something like that

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.280
or chaos and order. They were locked together.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:44.160
And it was that union of chaos and order that give rise, in the old Mesopotamian myth which is the Enuma Elish, to Being

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:49.200
to the old gods first and then eventually as creation progressed to human beings themselves

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.080
and so there's the idea lurking underneath these initial lines

00:20:54.080 --> 00:21:02.480
that God is akin to that which confronts the unknown and carves it into pieces and makes the world out of its pieces

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:09.800
and the thing that it confronts is something like a predatory reptile - something like a dragon or it's something like a serpent

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:16.200
and I think part of the reason for that, and this is a very deep and ancient idea, is that -

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.400
[exhale] this is where it gets so complicated to do the translation -

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:28.080
partly that is how human beings created our world. Like we went out beyond the confines of our safe spaces, let's say,

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.920
our safe spaces defined by the tree or defined by the fire

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:39.520
and we actively voyaged outward to the places that we were afraid of and didn't understand

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.120
and conquered and encountered things out there

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.920
like literally animals, like mammoths and snakes and predators of all sorts

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:55.800
and as a consequence of that active brave engagement with the domain of what we did not understand -

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.400
the terrifying domain of what we did not understand -

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.920
that the world in fact was generated

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:05.080
and that idea lurks deeply inside the opening lines of Genesis,

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.720
and it's a profound idea in my estimation.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:16.800
I think also that the way our brains are structured - and this is something that I'm going to try to develop more today - is that

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:24.680
the ancient circuits that our ancestors used to deal with the space beyond which they had already explored

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.660
so that would be home territory

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.180
so that's that unknown territory

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:28.680
 

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.360
that's characterized by promise

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.640
because there are new things out there

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.140
but also by intense danger

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.500
because we're prey animals

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.020
especially millions of years ago

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.640
when we were very young

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.640
we had to go out there and encounter

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.640
things that were terribly dangerous

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.280
and there was a kind of paternal courage

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.300
that went along with that

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.960
and it was the spirit of that paternal courage

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.080
that enabled the conquering of the unknown

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.840
and there is no difference between

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.640
the conquering of the unknown and the

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.280
creation of habitable order.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.700
The thing is, that as our cognitive faculties have developed,

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.180
to the point where we're capable of very high levels of abstraction,

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.880
the underlying biological architecture has remained the same.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.540
So I don't think it's too much to say at all

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.980
that the circuits that engage you - for example

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.860
when you're having an argument about something fundamental

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.300
with someone that you love.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.300
So you're trying to structure the world around you,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.200
jointly, to create a habitable space

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.300
that you both can exist within.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:33.700
You're using the same circuits - the abstracted version - that our archaic ancestors

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.120
would have used when they went out into the unknown itself

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:43.200
to encounter beasts and predators and geographical unknowns.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.280
It's the same circuit, it's just that we do it abstractly now instead of concretely.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.700
Of course it has to be the same circuit because evolution is a very conservative force.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.700
What else would it be?

00:23:54.700 --> 00:24:00.140
I think this it why it is so easy for us to demonize those people who are our enemies

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.660
because

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:07.760
our enemies confront us with what we don't want to see.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:15.260
And because of that our first response is to use snake detection circuitry on them.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:19.300
and that accounts for our capacity - almost      immediate capacity - to demonize.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.160
And there's a reason for that,

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.420
it's not a trivial thing.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.300
First of all it's a very fast response,

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:28.480
and second of all it's a response that has worked for a very very very long time.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.840
You know, one of the variants of the hero -

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.120
and I would consider a variant of the hero

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.580
like a fragment of the picture of God -

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.360
is the heroic warrior who slays the enemy.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:48.180
Of course, that's not precisely a politically correct representation of the hero in modern times.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.300
Well, and no wonder!

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.260
But it's still something that you go watch in movies all the time and admire, right?

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.800
It's like, one of the most -

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.440
How many plots are there?

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.380
Romance and adventure, that's about it.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.820
And most of the adventure genre is,

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.740
well, there's some enemy that's lurking in some form -

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.700
it could be human, it could be alien -

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.640
and someone rises up to go and confront it and maintain order, you know, it's like...

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.380
There's no getting away from that story.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:18.860
And if you don't have that in your own life, then you play a video game where that's happening,

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.980
or you watch a movie where that's happening, or you read a book where that's happening

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.400
and it captures you.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.820
Even if you're atheistic and your only religion is Star Wars, you know.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:29.340
[laughter]

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.460
Well, really! Really! Right? Really, it still captures your imagination.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:38.540
You act like someone who's possessed by religious fervor when you line up for three days

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.620
to be the first one into the theater, you know.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.240
And all the while claiming that you're atheistic to the core, it's like...

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.980
[laughter]

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.420
Okay, so, this

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.580
"without form and void" is this chaotic -

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:58.280
and it's a hard thing to get a grip on, what exactly this means

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.940
But I can give you another kind of example of

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:06.840
how you would experience the formless chaos of potential in your own lives,

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:11.440
and even how the order that you currently inhabit can dissolve into that.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.860
You know, in Dante's Inferno,

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.720
when he outlined the levels of Hell -

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:23.560
so Dante was trying to get to the bottom of what constituted evil in this representation,

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.920
so it's a work of psychology, and he's thinking,

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.860
there are various ways to behave reprehensibly,

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:34.340
but there's a hierarchy of reprehensible behavior, and there's something absolutely

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.780
the worst at the bottom.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.460
And Dante believed that it was betrayal.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.680
And I think that's right because, you know,

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.900
one of the things that enables

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.220
long-term peaceful cooperation between people is trust.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:53.200
And I would also say that trust is the fundamental natural resource.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.360
There's been some very good books written on the economic utility of trust, for example.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:04.680
Societies where the default economic presupposition between trading partners is trust

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.000
tend to be rich, even if they don't have any natural resources.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.180
You can see that, for example, with what happened with eBay, which I think was a kind of miracle

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.300
because what should've happened with eBay was that

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.760
you sent me junk, and I sent you a check that bounced, right?

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.240
And that was the end of eBay.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.040
[laughter]

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.240
Right, right, exactly.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.260
But that isn't what happened!

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:29.520
The default transaction on eBay was so honest that the brokers -

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.940
you could hire brokers to begin with, I can't remember what they were called exactly, but

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.840
you could pay someone a fee so that they would guarantee the transaction.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.640
So, you know, you wouldn't send me junk and I'd actually send you a payment

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.180
and we'd pay 10% for someone to guarantee that.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.180
The default trade was so honest that those things vanished right away.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.980
And so that meant all this frozen capital, roughly speaking, which were all the junk that people

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.880
had lying around that someone else might want,

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.220
instantly became money. And the only reason that worked was because people trusted one another.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.360
And so, trust is an unbelievably powerful economic force

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.660
maybe the most powerful economic force.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:06.960
Anyways,

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:12.120
if you have a relationship with someone, it's predicated on trust, and part of the reason for that is that

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.480
trust is what enables us to look at each other without running away screaming.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.560
And what I mean by that is that if I trust you,

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:24.000
then I don't have to take into account how complicated you are, because you're horribly complicated.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.360
I think chimpanzee full of snakes, that's what a human being is.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.360
[laughter]

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.260
And as long as you'll do what you say you'll do,

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.500
then I can take you at your word,

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.840
and your word simplifies you, and

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.200
you can take me at my word, and my word simplifies you, and then we can act like we understand each other

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.540
even though we don't.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.160
But then, if that trust is betrayed,

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.180
then all the snakes come forth very very rapidly.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.040
All of you, I suspect, have been betrayed one way or another

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.420
and so, what happens if you're in a relationship with someone

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.680
and you trust them,

00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.120
then you make certain assumptions about the past, and you make certain assumptions about the present,

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.180
and you make certain assumptions about the future.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.520
And everything's stable, so you're standing on solid ground.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.940
And the chaos, it's like you're standing on thin ice.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:14.760
The chaos is hidden. The shark beneath the waves isn't there. You're safe, you're in the lifeboat.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:19.420
But then if the person betrays you - like if you're in an intimate relationship and the person has an affair

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.680
and you find out about it, then you think,

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.740
one moment you're one place, right? You're where everything is secure

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.600
because you've predicated your perception of the world on the axiom of trust,

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.220
and the next second - really, the next second -

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.960
you're in a completely different place.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.700
And not only is that place different right now,

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.660
the place you were years ago is different,

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.880
and the place you're going to be in the future years hence is different.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.980
And so, all of that certainty

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:51.080
that strange certainty that you inhabit can collapse into incredible complexity.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.940
And you say, well if someone betrays you, you think,

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.200
"Okay, who were you?

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.040
"Because you weren't who I thought you were.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.820
"And I thought I knew you. But I didn't know you at all.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.360
"And I never knew you, and so all the things we did together,

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.120
"those weren't the things that I thought were happening. Something else was happening!

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.080
"And you're someone else.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.820
"That means I'm someone else because I thought I knew what was going on, and clearly I don't.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.420
"I'm some sort of blind sucker, or

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.540
"the victim of a psychopath or someone who's so naive that they can barely live.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.580
"And I don't understand anything about human beings,

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.720
"and I don't understand anything about myself,

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.900
"and I have no idea where I am now.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.360
"I thought I was at home, but I'm not. I'm in a house

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.240
"and it's full of strangers.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.140
I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow, or next week, or next year."

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.160
All of that certainty, that habitable certainty,

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.880
collapses right back into the potential from which it emerged.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.700
And that's a terrifying thing.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.200
That's a journey to the underworld from a mythological perspective.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.780
And that is really something worth knowing.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.860
Because journeys to the underworld are extraordinarily common in mythological stories.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:59.280
Like the hobbit going out to find Smaug, the dragon

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.680
and get the gold is the journey into the underworld.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.760
Journeys to the underworld happen all the time, and

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:08.180
modern people don't understand what the underworld is except that we've all been there.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.780
And we go there all the time.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.860
And we go there every time the solidity and the stability

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.860
of the world that we've erected, at least partly

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.500
through our speech, is shattered because

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.760
some sort of snake appears - that's another way of thinking about it.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.160
It's a really good way of thinking about it because

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:31.300
no matter how carefully you construct the little habitable area that's around you, there's always something

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.980
you didn't take into account, and there's always something that can pop up its head

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.340
and do you in and make you aware of your mortality

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.940
and age you, for that matter, or even kill you.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.740
That's the permanent situation of life,

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.740
which is part of the reason why I think the story of

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.780
Adam and Eve, for example, is archetypal.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.400
It's because we do inhabit walled gardens, right?

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.160
Because a walled garden is half structure, society, and

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.720
half nature, that's what a walled garden is.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.700
A walled garden is a place of

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:08.220
of paradise and warmth and love

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.200
and sustenance, but it's also the place where

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.500
something can pop up at any moment and knock you

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.380
out of it, and I think part of the reason that that story

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.340
exists at the beginning of this collection of books is

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:26.060
because it explains the eternal situation of human beings. We're always in that situation.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.460
We're in a walled garden.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.220
Or we bloody well hope we are.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.220
But there's always a snake. And it's even worse because

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.560
if there is a snake, we're exactly the sort of creatures

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.080
who are going to do nothing but go interact

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.800
with that snake the second that we can manage it.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.860
It's definitely the case that if you want a human being

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.160
to muck around with something, the best thing to do is

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.940
to tell them not ever to do it, have anything to do with it.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.760
Which is, of course, something you know if you have teenagers.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.880
[laughter]

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.940
Or even children.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.200
Or if you know anything about yourself, or your partner.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.660
So, these stories are trying to

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.140
express what you might describe as an unchanging,

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.440
transcendent reality.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.160
It's something like what's common across

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.740
across all human experience across all time.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.820
And that's what Jung essentially meant by an archetype.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.240
And you could say, well,

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.200
We tend to think that what we see

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.120
with our senses is real.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.260
Of course that's true, but what we see with our senses

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.260
is what's real that works at the time frame

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.000
that we exist in, right?

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.520
We see things that we can touch and pick up,

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.400
we see tools, essentially, that are useful for

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.300
our moment-to-moment activities.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.760
We don't see the structures of eternity,

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.360
especially not the abstract structures of eternity.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.880
We have to imagine those with our imagination.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.920
That's partly what these stories are doing—

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.860
they're saying, well,

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.160
There's forms of stability

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.140
that transcend our capacity to observe.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.480
Which is hardly surprising—

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.180
we know that if we're scientists, right?

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.700
'Cause we're always abstracting out things

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.580
that we can't immediately observe.

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.700
But there are metaphysical or moral realities

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.240
or phenomenological realities

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.920
that have the same nature:

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.940
you can't see them in your life

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.280
by observing them with your senses.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.780
But you can imagine them with your imagination.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.080
Sometimes the things you imagine with your imagination

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.080
are more real than the things that you see!

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.260
Numbers are like that, for example.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.120
There's endless examples of that.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.840
I would say, well...

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.060
This is also a good way of thinking about fiction

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.520
because a good work of fiction is more real

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.800
than the stories from which it was derived.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.760
Otherwise it has no staying power, right?

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.860
It's distilled reality.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.240
Even though, in some sense, "it never happened."

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.640
It's like, it depends on what you mean by "happened."

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.580
Y'know? It's—It's—

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.980
It's a pattern that repeats in many, many places,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.280
with variation.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.440
You extract out the central pattern.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:53.000
The pattern, purely, never existed in any specific form,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.580
But the fact that you've pulled a pattern

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.400
out from all those exemplars means that

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.380
you've extracted something real.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.780
And I think the reason that the

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.940
story of Adam and Eve—which we'll talk about

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.560
in quite a bit of detail today—

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.060
has been immune to being forgotten

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.220
is because it says things about

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.020
the nature of the human condition that are always true.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.220
I can give you another brief example.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.620
Like, people have a lot of guilt.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.380
Y'know, there's a line of social psychology that

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.160
claims that most people feel that they're better

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.260
than other people.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.680
I just don't buy that—that isn't what I've seen in my life.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.200
Maybe I'm a bit biased 'cause I'm a clinical psychologist,

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.320
and I see more people who are

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.560
overtly suffering, maybe, than people do in general.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.740
Although, I'm not so sure about that, y'know, because

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.340
you don't have to scratch very far beneath the surface

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.780
of most people's lives

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.440
before you find something truly tragic.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.300
And I don't mean the sort of tragedy that

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.740
you whine about, I mean

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.860
y'know, your mother has Alzheimer's, or

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.220
your best friend committed suicide, or

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.880
you have a close relative with cancer,

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.520
you have a sick child, or

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.060
there's something wrong with you

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.180
because almost everyone has at least one

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.220
really terrible thing wrong with them.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.520
And if you don't, hey, you will, so, y'know.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.300
[laughter]

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.340
So, y'know, that

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.440
tragic sense of Being is there with people all the time.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.260
And it's also the case that,

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.500
in my experience—

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.160
I rarely meet someone who says, "Hey, y'know,

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.740
"I'm doing everything I possibly can, I'm a hell of a guy,

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.580
and I can't see how I could possibly improve."

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:24.960
[laughter]

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.040
You meet someone like that,

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.300
you think they're narcissistic, right?

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.600
And you're right.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.680
[laughter]

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.420
But most people don't feel that way! They feel like

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.340
they could do a hell of a lot better than they are,

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.760
and they're quite acutely aware of their faults,

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.680
and they don't feel that they're what they should be.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.480
And you see,

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.920
what happens in the story of Adam and Eve as well

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.980
is that when people become self-conscious—

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.040
at least, that's how it looks to me—

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.740
they get thrown out of Paradise,

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:49.800
and then they're in history,

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.600
and history is a place where

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.580
there's pain in childbirth, and where

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.560
you're dominated by your mate, and where

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.420
you have to toil like mad—like no other animal

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.000
because you're aware of the future.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.100
You have to work and sacrifice the joys of the present

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.860
for the future—constantly!

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.480
And you know you're going to die.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.220
You have all that weight on you.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.640
To me, again, that's just—

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.400
how can anything be more true than that?

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.700
As far as I can tell, that's just how it is for—

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.120
unless you're naive beyond comprehension!

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.040
There's something about your life

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.320
that is echoed in that representation.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.960
And why it is that p— I mean,

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.940
we're such strange creatures because

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.860
we don't seem to really fit into Being, in some sense.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:35.100
That's also what's expressed in the notion of the Fall.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.040
The existentialists said people feel like they have

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.080
a debt that they have to pay off to existence

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.500
for the crime of their Being.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.680
Something like that.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.160
Maybe it's because we're acutely aware that we have to

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.640
offer something of value to the people around us so that

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.260
they can tolerate us.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.560
Y'know, while we're going about our business, but

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.480
it seems deeper than that. It's that

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.840
human beings seem to exist in a post-cataclysmic

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.380
world, and that's exactly also what's represented

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.120
in Genesis. It's very interesting because

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.060
in the Adam and Eve story, there's two—

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.220
there's two catastrophes, essentially.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.140
There's the catastrophe that occurs when Adam and

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.800
Eve wake up—which we'll talk about in detail—

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.540
and become self-conscious and know they're naked.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.160
And their eyes are opened, right?

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.360
That's the terminology that's used, and to have

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.100
your eyes opened means to have a...

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.860
an increment in consciousness, essentially.

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.720
'Cause eyes are associated with consciousness

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.560
for human beings 'cause we're intensely visual animals.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.560
And so the metaphor for having your eyes opened

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.560
means—is the same as the metaphor

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.700
of coming to consciousness, and as soon as Adam

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.200
and Eve come to consciousness, they

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.220
realize they're naked.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.880
The classic interpretation of that is it has something

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.840
to do with sexual sin, and I don't believe that.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.520
I don't believe that's what it means.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.680
Although there are elements about that that're relevant.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.980
It's more that to realize that you're naked...

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.600
It's like—y'know,

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.820
if you dream that you're naked and on a stage

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.600
in front of people, that's not a sexual dream, man!

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.980
Unless you're some kind of strange exhibitionist, right?

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.040
[laughter]

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.120
You wanna cover yourself up and get the hell off

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.040
that stage as fast as possible!

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.160
And so, to be naked in front of a crowd

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.620
is to have everyone—

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:18.780
it's to have the judgement of the social world focused

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:23.040
on your self-evident inadequacies.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.720
And that makes people self-conscious.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.300
That's a real human state—it's associated with

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.920
neuroticism in the Big Five trait model, but

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.520
people don't like that at all. They don't like having their

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.340
fragility and vulnerability exposed to the group.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.620
It's one of the two major fears of people.

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.740
'Cause one is social humiliation.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:43.380
And the other is something like mortality and death.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.380
[chuckle]

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.800
Your typical agoraphobic, for example, gets to have both

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.880
those fears at the same time because she—

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.020
it's usually a she—

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.280
tends to believe she's going to have a very

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.040
spectacular and exhibitionistic heart attack in a public

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.320
place, and make a terrible fool of herself

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.660
while she's dying.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.220
[laughter]

02:06:05.780 --> 02:06:10.420
Requested P offer his look at human's appointment to further create.

02:06:10.420 --> 02:06:12.940
Here's something interesting too; we will develop this a lot.

02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:16.640
You see, when Adam and Eve eat the fruit,

02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:18.640
when the snake gives them the fruit,

02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:20.640
the thing that happens is their eyes are opened.

02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:23.780
Okay, to me that means that they've woken up.

02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:26.180
there's been an increment in their consciousness.

02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:29.380
The next thing that happens is they recognize that they're naked.

02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:33.200
To recognize that you're naked is to recognize that you're vulnerable.

02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:35.720
Human beings are strange creatures [JBP bends over]

02:06:35.860 --> 02:06:38.700
most animals are like this, and they're protected. But not us.

02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:44.620
[stands tall] Our most vulnerable parts are displayed for harm and for everyone to observe.

02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:49.280
Right, so we have that sort of bipedal self-consciousness built into us.

02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:53.180
But what is really interesting, is that when Adam and Eve realize that they're naked

02:06:53.620 --> 02:06:57.140
it's the same moment that they know the difference between good and evil.

02:06:57.140 --> 02:07:01.320
and that -- God -- that, I just ground away on that for years

02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:02.800
[just-out-of-vision stammers]

02:07:03.020 --> 02:07:08.940
what's the relationship between consciousness, knowledge of nakedness and the knowledge of good and evil?

02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:10.940
I think I figured it out.

02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:12.940
I think it was that --

02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:14.920
you see -- when you know that you're vulnerable....

02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:18.980
And they also developed knowledge of death, right? So

02:07:18.980 --> 02:07:22.480
So it's deep knowledge of vulnerability.  They get embarrassed about that. They cover themselves up, right?

02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:23.600
So that's culture.

02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:27.420
So it's a very profound shock for them to recognize that they're naked.

02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:29.480
It even makes Adam hide from God.

02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:31.900
Then they develop the knowledge of good and evil.

02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:37.740
Well, I think because, you see, human beings have this peculiar capacity that no other creature has,

02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:39.900
which is I know how I can be hurt,

02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:43.360
because I am aware of my own limitations. Painfully aware.

02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:47.720
And now because I know how I can be hurt, I know how you can be hurt.

02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:50.180
And I can take advantage of that.

02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:53.700
And that's how evil enters the world. That's how it looks like to me.

02:07:53.700 --> 02:07:58.880
I've got this expansion of knowledge. It says in Genesis that that gives people

02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:01.920
another attribute of divinity: knowing the difference between good and evil.

02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:03.920
It has nothing to do with animals

02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:06.680
and it has nothing to do with Adam and Eve prior to having their eyes open.

02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:11.120
But the cosmos switches when that self-consciousness manifests itself.

02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:15.520
That's when the possibility of evil enters the world. It's something like that.

02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:19.960
That's also echoed by the intimate relationship between the snake in the Garden of Eden

02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:24.540
and Satan. [Stammers]

02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:27.540
That's a very strange association.

02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:30.700
It's like this snake also becomes the adversary of being.

02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:33.680
and I think I'll jump very quickly into that, but

02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:36.640
But I think that's because  [first] there's the snake that bites you in the jungle;

02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:39.480
and then there's the snake that lives in your enemy;

02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:45.460
And then there's the snake that lives in your family if you banish the enemy to the netherlands.

02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:52.580
Then there's the snake that lives in you if you remove yourself from your family.

02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:54.580
And that snake that's in you -- right --

02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:56.580
that's a psychological phenomena, that's

02:08:56.580 --> 02:09:00.680
equivalent to transcendent evil itself --

02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:02.680
the thing that inhabits every single person.

02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:04.680
And that's why there's that association between the snake and Satan.

02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:14.280
and that's where I think people have this... it's associated with our knowledge of vulnerability that gives us this constant capacity for evil.

02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:16.300
Can you Imagine if you're a medieval torturer?

02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:18.480
-- you know people don't generally imagine that sort of thing --

02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:24.080
but people were medieval torturers and they were very good at what they did.

02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:27.280
The only way you can be a torturer is to know what would hurt you.

02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:33.740
Right, and so you exploit the knowledge of your own vulnerability to bring pain into the world.

02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:37.680
I don't think you can lay that precisely at God's feet.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:43.220
Now people have been arguing about that for a very long time.

02:09:43.420 --> 02:09:49.200
The question for me that arose from that. Fine, like tragedy, you can lay that at God's feet.

02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:57.900
Well if we didn't bring additional evil into the world, could we tolerate the tragedy of being without becoming corrupt?

02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:01.600
Well I think generally the answer to that is:Yes, as I've seen people react

02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:05.100
quite heroically to the arbitrary burdens of their life.

02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:08.560
but malevolence: man, that lays them low.

02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:11.840
It seems to be nothing but a destructive force.

02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:15.820
I do believe this as well -- you see it in the Cain and Abel story -- that

02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:21.180
the root for malevolence is the desire for revenge against God for creation itself.

02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:26.680
I've read terrible things written by terrible people, trying to get to the bottom of things.

02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:28.660
I've mentioned the Columbine killers for example.

02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:32.160
It's clear. All you have to do is read what they wrote.

02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:34.960
What they were doing was taking revenge against God. They knew that.

02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:41.720
It wasn't unconscious. They'd been dwelling on this for months, plotting their revenge.

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:44.880
And it was against for being itself, for the crime of being.
