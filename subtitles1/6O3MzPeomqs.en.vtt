so<00:04:59.759><c> first</c><00:05:00.600><c> of</c><00:05:00.780><c> all</c>

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
so first of all
 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.670 align:start position:0%

really

really
emerges<00:05:06.660><c> at</c><00:05:06.840><c> puberty</c><00:05:07.320><c> so</c><00:05:07.440><c> boys</c><00:05:07.680><c> and</c><00:05:07.860><c> girls</c><00:05:07.979><c> are</c>

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
emerges at puberty so boys and girls are
 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.310 align:start position:0%
emerges at puberty so boys and girls are
pretty<00:05:08.460><c> evenly</c><00:05:08.820><c> matched</c><00:05:09.240><c> physically</c><00:05:09.600><c> but</c>

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
pretty evenly matched physically but
 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.189 align:start position:0%
pretty evenly matched physically but
once<00:05:10.620><c> puberty</c><00:05:11.100><c> kicks</c><00:05:11.460><c> in</c><00:05:11.580><c> boys</c><00:05:12.300><c> are</c><00:05:12.600><c> taller</c>

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
once puberty kicks in boys are taller
 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.350 align:start position:0%
once puberty kicks in boys are taller
stronger<00:05:13.740><c> heavier</c><00:05:14.220><c> and</c><00:05:14.699><c> they're</c><00:05:15.060><c> much</c>

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
stronger heavier and they're much
 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.930 align:start position:0%
stronger heavier and they're much
stronger<00:05:16.139><c> in</c><00:05:16.560><c> terms</c><00:05:16.740><c> of</c><00:05:16.860><c> upper</c><00:05:17.220><c> body</c><00:05:17.340><c> strength</c>

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
stronger in terms of upper body strength
 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.570 align:start position:0%
stronger in terms of upper body strength
so<00:05:18.479><c> women</c><00:05:18.660><c> are</c><00:05:18.900><c> at</c><00:05:19.080><c> a</c><00:05:19.259><c> disadvantage</c>

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
so women are at a disadvantage
 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.909 align:start position:0%
so women are at a disadvantage
physically<00:05:21.479><c> in</c><00:05:22.080><c> relationship</c><00:05:22.440><c> to</c><00:05:22.740><c> anything</c>

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 align:start position:0%
physically in relationship to anything
 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.230 align:start position:0%
physically in relationship to anything

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
that might have to do with physical
 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.930 align:start position:0%
that might have to do with physical
combat<00:05:24.900><c> and</c><00:05:25.440><c> so</c><00:05:25.680><c> on</c><00:05:26.039><c> those</c><00:05:26.220><c> grounds</c><00:05:26.580><c> it</c><00:05:26.759><c> makes</c>

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
combat and so on those grounds it makes
 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.550 align:start position:0%
combat and so on those grounds it makes
sense<00:05:27.120><c> for</c><00:05:27.419><c> women</c><00:05:27.539><c> to</c><00:05:27.840><c> be</c><00:05:28.020><c> somewhat</c><00:05:28.320><c> more</c>

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%

that

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
that

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
less compelling but
 

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.590 align:start position:0%
less compelling but
but<00:21:33.960><c> I</c><00:21:34.260><c> think</c><00:21:34.559><c> it's</c><00:21:34.799><c> worth</c><00:21:35.179><c> contemplating</c><00:21:36.179><c> is</c>

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
but I think it's worth contemplating is
 

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.070 align:start position:0%
but I think it's worth contemplating is
that<00:21:37.380><c> the</c><00:21:38.159><c> the</c><00:21:38.640><c> distribution</c><00:21:39.299><c> of</c><00:21:39.659><c> sexual</c>

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.529 align:start position:0%
that the the distribution of sexual

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%

01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:16.250 align:start position:0%
to me
and<01:20:14.460><c> I</c><01:20:14.640><c> ended</c><01:20:14.880><c> up</c><01:20:15.000><c> downplaying</c><01:20:15.480><c> it</c><01:20:15.600><c> in</c><01:20:15.780><c> in</c><01:20:16.020><c> my</c>

01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
and I ended up downplaying it in in my
 

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.169 align:start position:0%
and I ended up downplaying it in in my
head<01:20:16.440><c> it</c><01:20:16.860><c> was</c><01:20:16.980><c> like</c>

01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
head it was like
 

01:20:18.179 --> 01:20:20.330 align:start position:0%
head it was like
well<01:20:18.780><c> nobody</c><01:20:19.199><c> noticed</c>

01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:20.340 align:start position:0%

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:22.669 align:start position:0%
well nobody noticed
and<01:20:21.000><c> nobody</c><01:20:21.239><c> nobody</c><01:20:21.659><c> saw</c>

01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
and nobody nobody saw
 

01:20:22.679 --> 01:20:25.550 align:start position:0%
and nobody nobody saw
so<01:20:23.460><c> maybe</c><01:20:23.880><c> it</c><01:20:24.179><c> doesn't</c><01:20:24.600><c> matter</c><01:20:24.780><c> what</c><01:20:25.199><c> exactly</c>

01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
so maybe it doesn't matter what exactly
 

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.770 align:start position:0%
so maybe it doesn't matter what exactly
happened<01:20:25.860><c> what</c><01:20:26.580><c> exactly</c><01:20:26.940><c> happened</c><01:20:27.179><c> to</c><01:20:27.420><c> you</c><01:20:27.600><c> if</c>

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.930 align:start position:0%
 
but<01:30:48.840><c> it</c><01:30:49.020><c> kind</c><01:30:49.440><c> of</c><01:30:49.560><c> I</c><01:30:49.739><c> didn't</c><01:30:50.340><c> really</c><01:30:50.520><c> question</c>

01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
but it kind of I didn't really question
 

01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:52.970 align:start position:0%
but it kind of I didn't really question
it<01:30:51.239><c> much</c><01:30:51.420><c> of</c><01:30:51.480><c> the</c><01:30:51.600><c> time</c><01:30:51.719><c> it</c><01:30:51.900><c> was</c><01:30:52.020><c> just</c><01:30:52.139><c> like</c><01:30:52.260><c> oh</c>

01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
it much of the time it was just like oh
 

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.590 align:start position:0%
it much of the time it was just like oh
um

01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.030 align:start position:0%
um
I<01:30:55.020><c> guess</c>

01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
I guess
 

01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:00.110 align:start position:0%
I guess
this<01:30:56.340><c> is</c><01:30:56.580><c> just</c><01:30:57.239><c> normal</c><01:30:58.199><c> and</c><01:30:58.739><c> I've</c><01:30:59.219><c> I'm</c><01:30:59.760><c> not</c><01:31:00.000><c> the</c>

01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
this is just normal and I've I'm not the
 

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:02.870 align:start position:0%
this is just normal and I've I'm not the
only<01:31:00.239><c> one</c><01:31:00.420><c> going</c><01:31:00.600><c> through</c><01:31:00.840><c> this</c>

01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
only one going through this
 

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.689 align:start position:0%
only one going through this
right<01:31:03.540><c> right</c><01:31:03.620><c> well</c><01:31:04.620><c> and</c><01:31:04.800><c> you</c><01:31:05.040><c> were</c><01:31:05.159><c> already</c><01:31:05.340><c> a</c>

01:31:05.689 --> 01:31:05.699 align:start position:0%
right right well and you were already a
 

01:31:05.699 --> 01:31:07.310 align:start position:0%
right right well and you were already a
long<01:31:05.820><c> way</c><01:31:05.940><c> down</c><01:31:06.179><c> the</c><01:31:06.360><c> road</c><01:31:06.540><c> and</c><01:31:06.840><c> so</c><01:31:07.020><c> I</c><01:31:07.199><c> guess</c>

01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
long way down the road and so I guess
 

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:09.890 align:start position:0%
long way down the road and so I guess
you<01:31:08.040><c> checked</c><01:31:08.400><c> off</c><01:31:08.520><c> the</c><01:31:08.699><c> boxes</c><01:31:09.179><c> as</c><01:31:09.480><c> far</c><01:31:09.600><c> as</c><01:31:09.719><c> the</c>

01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:09.900 align:start position:0%
you checked off the boxes as far as the
 

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:11.689 align:start position:0%
you checked off the boxes as far as the
medical<01:31:10.020><c> practitioners</c><01:31:10.800><c> were</c><01:31:11.040><c> concerned</c><01:31:11.460><c> but</c>

01:31:11.689 --> 01:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
medical practitioners were concerned but
 

01:31:11.699 --> 01:31:14.450 align:start position:0%
medical practitioners were concerned but
at<01:31:12.360><c> that</c><01:31:12.480><c> point</c><01:31:12.659><c> it's</c><01:31:12.960><c> also</c><01:31:13.320><c> for</c><01:31:14.040><c> you</c><01:31:14.219><c> it's</c>

01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
at that point it's also for you it's
 

01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:17.030 align:start position:0%
at that point it's also for you it's
going<01:31:14.639><c> to</c><01:31:14.760><c> be</c><01:31:14.880><c> increasingly</c><01:31:15.420><c> difficult</c><01:31:15.840><c> to</c>

01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
going to be increasingly difficult to
 

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.250 align:start position:0%
going to be increasingly difficult to
you<01:31:17.580><c> know</c><01:31:17.639><c> to</c><01:31:17.880><c> reverse</c><01:31:18.239><c> your</c><01:31:18.420><c> decision</c><01:31:18.780><c> you're</c>

01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
you know to reverse your decision you're
 

01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:21.229 align:start position:0%
you know to reverse your decision you're
already<01:31:19.500><c> in</c><01:31:19.860><c> a</c><01:31:20.100><c> couple</c><01:31:20.219><c> of</c><01:31:20.340><c> years</c>

01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
already in a couple of years
 

01:31:21.239 --> 01:31:22.729 align:start position:0%
already in a couple of years
you<01:31:21.659><c> know</c><01:31:21.719><c> and</c><01:31:21.840><c> that's</c><01:31:22.020><c> a</c><01:31:22.199><c> long</c><01:31:22.320><c> time</c><01:31:22.500><c> when</c>

01:31:22.729 --> 01:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
you know and that's a long time when
 

01:31:22.739 --> 01:31:25.129 align:start position:0%
you know and that's a long time when
you're<01:31:22.860><c> only</c><01:31:23.040><c> 14</c><01:31:23.340><c> and</c><01:31:23.880><c> so</c>

01:31:25.129 --> 01:31:25.139 align:start position:0%
you're only 14 and so
 

01:31:25.139 --> 01:31:27.410 align:start position:0%
you're only 14 and so
so<01:31:25.440><c> it</c><01:31:25.679><c> was</c><01:31:25.860><c> on</c><01:31:26.219><c> to</c><01:31:26.400><c> the</c><01:31:26.580><c> next</c><01:31:26.699><c> step</c><01:31:26.940><c> so</c><01:31:27.239><c> that</c>

01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
so it was on to the next step so that
 

01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:30.110 align:start position:0%
so it was on to the next step so that
happened<01:31:27.600><c> when</c><01:31:27.900><c> you</c><01:31:28.020><c> were</c><01:31:28.139><c> 15</c><01:31:28.380><c> and</c><01:31:28.980><c> so</c><01:31:29.280><c> what</c>

01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
happened when you were 15 and so what
 

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.850 align:start position:0%
happened when you were 15 and so what
was<01:31:30.300><c> the</c><01:31:30.480><c> consequence</c><01:31:30.960><c> of</c><01:31:31.260><c> the</c><01:31:31.560><c> double</c>
