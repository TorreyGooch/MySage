Who's a professor at NYU and I have him here for a bunch of reasons

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.360
Jonathan is an extremely interesting researcher. I've been following his work on disgust and political belief for

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.120
Literally for decades he was one of the first people who

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:22.189
started to do serious research on disgust which is its own emotional system and therefore very much worth attending to

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.830
But we also have some other

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.080
interests in common Jonathan also

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.110
Started this institute called the Heterodox Academy

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.769
Which is attempting to bring back a reasonable diversity of views or what he regards as a reasonable diversity of views to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.889
University faculty and and campuses and discussions, so I first met Jonathan

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.099
It's gonna be just about 30 years ago

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.750
25 years ago in

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.799
2014 yeah I'm sorry it was in 1994 was in 1994 yeah yeah right right so yeah

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:58.699
You came to do a job talk at Harvard to for an assistant professorship position

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.850
and I had been aware of your work on disgust then and and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.809
Agitated hard for them to hire you because I thought it was of great significance

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.859
Which turned out to be exactly the case, so what do you remember about that?

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.140
I Remember I was so excited to have an interview at Harvard. It was my only interview. If I didn't get that job

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.559
I had no job for the following year, and it was a very strange day in which I didn't feel particularly

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.209
Welcomed or wanted, and then I had my session with you in which it was this guy who was it he had it

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.639
He actually got a job at Harvard, and he was studying Jung which is like almost taboo

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.649
And he was talking about dreams and creativity

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.949
And so I just that was the really bright that was the bright memory of the day was our hour-long conversation

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.719
Yeah, well I was also really interested at the time man now in in the biological basis of behavior right and so and and in

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.000
in the relationship between fundamental motivational systems and thought because

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.789
Obviously our thought is grounded in fundamental motivational systems and your work on disgust

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.310
Which maybe you can tell the viewers a little bit about was really interesting to me because it was an emotional system that

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.780
Hadn't been studied much. I mean you were really one of the pioneers in the in the psychological study of disgust

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.169
Well the way to explain it is that Paul Rozin, my advisor at Penn is

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.429
The pioneer in the study of disgust, and he'd studied it as a food-related emotion

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.079
he'd written a bit about it being a moral emotion and I was a graduate student at Penn and

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.140
I was interested in morality, and I was reading the Bible and I was reading

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.649
anthropological accounts of different countries and different cultures and at the time morality was all about

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:46.140
Reasoning, about harm, rights and justice so Lawrence Kohlberg was the leading figure in the field and because I was looking at morality across cultures

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.899
And when you look across cultures

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.890
It's not just about fairness and harm and rights, it's about menstruation and food taboos and skin lesions

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.489
And it's very physical, and I was you know why why do so many

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.220
Societies why is it like the normal default way of being is to somehow bring the body into morality?

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.970
Why is that and so I just happened to be at Penn where the world's expert in

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.130
disgust was I went to talk to him and that started one of the best collaborations of my life and

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.480
What it led to is is a broadening of the of the moral domain basically, there's a sort of Western

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.949
Secular approach that you see in Western philosophers either morality is about harm and utilitarianism

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.310
It's minimize harm, or it's about rights and principles

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.390
Immanuel Kant and

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.440
a

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.749
Much better way psychologically, I think about morality is virtue ethics. It's just a lot of stuff

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.239
it's just we have just a lot of stuff that we judge on and

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.399
This led me eventually to realize that people on the left and people on the right

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.749
Care about different stuff everybody cares about harm and fairness

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:59.219
But the stuff about keeping you know boundaries around the group build a wall protect the group hold the group together

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.000
hate traitors

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.729
You know everybody can do that

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:09.749
But right wing morality builds on these additional additional foundations of these additional emotions and foundations

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.159
So that work on disgust that I was just beginning to talk about then when we first met in

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.369
1994 led eventually to what we now call moral foundations theory and with my-- with about five or six

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.859
colleagues if you go to yourmorals.org

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.910
You can take our test you can learn all about it

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.589
But it led to the perspective that

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.290
Ultimately was I think the right perspective as the cultural war was heating up and as left and right

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.559
We're essentially becoming like different countries different cultures

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.619
So so it's not obvious on

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.430
first

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.430
Consideration why disgust would be a moral emotion so you know most of the work

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.309
That's done. That's outside of the disgust realm

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.080
I would say is predicated on the assumption that the reason that conservatives in particular

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.689
But perhaps people who are more authoritarian in general draw boundaries around their territories

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.890
Because they're afraid of the other

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:09.330
But that isn't really that isn't really how it plays out as far as I can tell because conservatives for example are less neurotic than

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.419
Trait in the big five traits sense than liberals although. It's um

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.510
It's a minor difference

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:20.700
But the disgust issue seems to be particularly relevant, so so can you tell us a little bit about why disgust per se?

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.179
Well first conservatives are a little less neurotic

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.090
But they also at if you do very low level perceptual experiment just like a puff of white noise in the ear

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.229
People who react more strongly to that to any sort of very low level threat are more likely to vote Republican in this country

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.569
So they're you know there are all these interesting personality differences that lead to different politics, but as for why disgust?

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.119
So I'm I'm a Durkheimian. I would say I love the

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.890
Sociologist Ã‰mile Durkheim, and I'm also a social psychologist

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.789
So I'm always thinking not about people as individual utility maximizers

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.249
But people as members of social groups people who are totally focused on

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.399
Belonging in their social groups and people who have some pro-social motives about keeping the group together

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.190
About doing things that are good for the group, so as I try to argue in my book The Righteous Mind. Yes

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.880
We're selfish

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.070
There's no doubt that we often will do things to advance our own self-interest at the expense of others

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:26.820
But we're also really group-ish which means we'll do all sorts of things to advance our group at the expense of others

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:35.310
Basically, we're tribal. We evolved as a tribal species and we're doing we have all this software. I would say oh, there's all these

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.680
predispositions

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.199
predispositions for life in in tribes that are battling other tribes

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:47.539
And that's why it comes out so easily if you look at the way boys organize themselves when they get a fraternity

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.359
The hazing rituals when you look at the way

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.040
It's especially clear in boys the way street gangs organize themselves girls tribalism is a little different

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.799
But I would say this is and that's why again. I love the Jungian approach of archetypes there's something

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.440
There's just this weird stuff that is pan-human

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.729
Even if it comes out slightly differently around the world there really is a human nature

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:12.679
And it comes complete with a whole bunch of like pre-designed ideas, so there was a new article

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.310
I think it was published in Nature. I'll try to find a link for it. It's about a year old

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.250
That was based on

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.240
high-resolution imaging of

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.570
Neuronal connections, and it's actually reviewed in Kurzweil's book How to [Create] a Mind

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.020
I think that's the name of it

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:35.090
And so it turns out that the cortex is made out of these columnar structures that are pre-organized units of neurons

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.220
And they're replicated across the entire cortex. It's basically the same structure and like the

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.020
The older let's say Connectionist idea was that neurons that fire together wire together right that's happening of course

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:55.099
That's pretty standard neurology, but the the columns are already pre-wired, so it's actually columns that fire together that wire together

00:07:55.099 --> 00:08:02.959
But there's but there's even more with the high-resolution scanning, so it turns out that underneath the columnar structure there are these pre-built

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.219
Highways that are connected connective tissue that are pre

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.310
pre-prepared so the columns have the option to

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:15.739
connect to the to the underlying highway, and then that highway can connect to other columns, so it's as if

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:23.028
Implicit in the brain organization, and this is at the cortical levels say nothing of subcortical organization. There's already

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.880
preexistent

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:32.930
Likelihoods that certain neurons will fire will wire together. Yeah, so and and what else is cool is that this is actually

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.690
architecturally quite

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:42.439
Regular, so they found that the these super highways are arranged in lines, and and and and in

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:49.639
At right angles to one another so it's almost like a three-dimensional structure of wired cubes that underlies the neuronal structure

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.039
So that's some neurological evidence for the archetypal idea, so let me just explain to explain to the viewers here

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.000
Why this isn't just some like

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.649
psychological geek conversation

00:08:58.649 --> 00:09:03.289
This is actually really relevant to a lot of the things that we'll be talking about and that your audience probably cares about

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:08.749
because one of the most contested ideas in the social sciences is the idea of innateness and

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.100
Yeah, the idea is well

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:15.949
If something is innate then it can't it can't vary across societies, and if it varies across societies

00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:18.679
then it's not innate and if gender varies if

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.219
Masculinity or femininity vary across societies then it's not innate

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.660
It's socially constructed

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.480
But that's the wrong understanding of innateness

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.740
The definition that I use comes from Gary Marcus who was actually a neuroscientist here at NYU

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.609
He says innate doesn't mean hardwired is almost nothing interesting

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.570
That's hardwired innate means structured in advance of experience

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:44.899
But then experience can still revise it and boy does that work for gender for almost everything

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:51.889
Yeah, that's right almost everything that we're not a blank slate about anything and something I used to tell my students at UVA I taught

00:09:51.889 --> 00:09:55.369
At UVA for 16 years is you know everything's a social construction

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.760
masculinity femininity

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.539
Cancer the Sun death everything

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.130
There's a social construction for you won't find a society that doesn't have thoughts about these things

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:14.300
but the fact that societies have social constructions tells us nothing about whether there's not also an

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:20.990
Underlying biological reality and in almost all cases there is well otherwise we wouldn't be able to communicate which is one of EO Wilson's

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:27.079
Comments right when I mean Wilson is the entomologist to study ants at Harvard and also wrote number of books about

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:29.959
Sociobiology that got him in trouble with the radical leftists

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:34.879
And he said even if we could communicate with ants there would be nothing to say to each other because their

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.209
Fundamental mode of being in the world is based on

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:43.190
Motivations and interests that are so different from ours that there wouldn't be any structure for communication

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.479
And you can kind of tell that with regards to the animals that we make friends with right

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.789
We're much more likely to make friends with animals who has a who have a fundamental biological and social nature

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:58.069
That's very close to ours like dogs because we can basically speak their language even though not completely

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:03.729
A mammal language of love and you know I miss you, and I want to play you yeah, that's right

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.230
Yeah, exactly and that bonding. Yeah, okay, so back to discuss back to discuss so

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:14.529
So the fundamental thing that I learned from Paul Rozin is to see us as these amazing omnivores

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.249
This is part of our survival strategy even more than other other Apes

00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:25.359
We are just brilliant omnivores, and we have the Omnivore's Dilemma, which is we've got to be interested in all kinds of new stuff

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.869
We're not tied to any place we can roam on to a whole new continent, so we're interested in stuff

00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:37.118
But stuff has all kinds of toxins and microbes so we have to be careful about that stuff

00:11:37.119 --> 00:11:38.589
And so these motives have to be in tension

00:11:38.589 --> 00:11:43.839
And this is actually an interesting way to understand the left-right difference you have to have both motives

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:50.379
But if so imagine two siblings one of whom is set more towards trying new stuff seeking out new stuff

00:11:50.379 --> 00:11:51.699
And the other is a little more fearful

00:11:51.699 --> 00:11:55.989
Then we're like whoa no let's you know let's not try that let's stay with what's tried-and-true

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.289
I mean that's progressivism and conservatives, and that's the origins of it

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.909
And if you look at kids behavior at the age of two or three it does predict

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:08.529
How they'll vote much later not hugely, but there is a clear prediction there, so

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:17.079
so disgust is part of a regulatory system about our engagement with the world and whether we are just sort of out there and

00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:19.748
You know we we seek out variety and diversity

00:12:19.749 --> 00:12:24.489
We think diversity is just a great thing or whether we want a little more order structure predictability

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.670
conservatives are neater than

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.979
progressives if you take photos of their rooms

00:12:32.029 --> 00:12:37.058
You know you can actually you know cleanliness and organization you can predict how they vote

00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:44.799
Disgust it turns out what's really cool about disgust in modern politics is if you look at all the different things that we're fighting over

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.939
Especially in this country our culture wars over. You know going back a few decades

00:12:48.939 --> 00:12:52.389
You know sex, drugs, the flag, immigration all of these things

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.139
I have a study with my colleagues which was led by Sena

00:12:56.139 --> 00:13:03.428
Koleva in which we asked all these cultural war attitudes of people and we also had their scores in the disgust scale

00:13:03.429 --> 00:13:07.689
But one of the foundations of morality is sanctity and purity and it relates to disgust

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.110
What we found is that if you know if you know

00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:19.429
What people's left-right how they place themselves in a left-right scale you can pretty much predict where they fall out on most culture war

00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:25.909
Attitudes except for those that load on or implicate sanctity or purity so what I mean is

00:13:26.459 --> 00:13:27.589
flag-burning, okay

00:13:27.589 --> 00:13:32.479
Do you think you know do you think that people should have the right to burn the American flag or the country's flag as an

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.860
Expression as a political action. What do you think people just give some answer on a one to seven scale and

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.959
People on the right think you know more like they say no people on the left with yes

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.420
People who score high on loyalty are more likely to say no people who lower on it

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.289
Say yes, and that's even taking account of where they're on the left-right dimension, but here's the cool thing

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:56.419
It's only if you add in the purity or sanctity thing that you can really understand

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:02.000
What people are doing because some people see the flag not as just a piece of cloth

00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:05.659
They see it as having some innate essence some something sacred about it

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.350
Which must be protected and so so this is

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.740
They think of it as a unifying center. Exactly, that's right

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.909
So if there's something sacred and this is that this is the central piece of my work around

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.610
Politics and morality is the psychology of sanctity

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:26.119
If you hold something sacred then your team circles around it and it's only

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:31.669
Those who circle around with you and sometimes literally circle around like Muslims at prayer in Mecca

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.240
They literally Circle the Kaaba circling is a very primitive ancient

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:40.639
It feels right to circle something, but even if even if you do it symbolically or you all bow at the same time

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:47.690
That binds you together. Children do that with their mothers when they when they engage in exploratory behavior, right well

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:53.569
They use their mother as a center of the world and children differ in the degree to which they'll move outward from their mothers

00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:58.969
So they move out until they they they trip over there their uncertainty threshold

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.579
Is it a distance like it's a distance?

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:08.060
And so so the more exploratory kids who are lower in negative emotion will go out farther before they come back to their mother

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.529
So the mother's a center

00:15:09.529 --> 00:15:11.529
And you know that that would be associated

00:15:11.939 --> 00:15:15.799
Symbolically with the idea of the center as a motherland or potentially as a fatherland

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.789
That's right that makes sense so this way that we're we are incredibly symbolic creatures

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.490
we're not just out to make as much money as we can we're

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.729
Symbolic and social creatures and this psychology of sanctity or purity has become really

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.390
Not just on the right. It's always been important for

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:36.219
Especially religious conservatives, we're beginning to see it even on the campus left

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.989
and this is why I think we see some of the odd things we see on campus that the

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.289
Campus must be kept as a sacred and pure space

00:15:44.899 --> 00:15:49.509
One of the things that really alarms me about what's happened on campus the last couple of years is that

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:54.070
The older idea we had that it's a place for contesting ideas

00:15:54.290 --> 00:16:00.519
It's a it's a zone of enormous choice people can take what courses they want to say what they want it's kind of a wonderful

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:08.950
free-for-all with some with norms of respect it's now becoming much more of a religious zone where the perimeter of the campus is the

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:13.599
Boundaries and within it's there are almost they're blasphemy laws basically

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:17.860
And I really started noticing this when you look at the videos of the Middlebury

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.649
protests when Charles Murray spoke at Middlebury and

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:26.349
As everybody knows he was shouted down so the students are chanting and they're chanting in unison

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:34.149
And it seems like a religious revival meeting and they're swaying and they're saying their sacred you know racist, sexist

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.140
Anti-gay, Charles Murray, go away. It's like a ritual incantation

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.580
So that all-- to define the space as safe, and it's safe and look I'm the maternal warden

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.320
So far all this happening is they're binding together

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:53.169
They're moving at you know synchronous movement and call and response so it it's using a lot of tropes from religion and religious worship

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.829
But here's the cool thing

00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:58.239
When the administrator I forget who it is comes on to say

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.589
okay, we have moved we're moving the talk and

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:07.209
Then you hear a couple people screaming out "off campus, off campus"

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:14.799
And he says to another location on campus, and there's like oh no no

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:20.739
Because you know look no one had to go to this talk so everyone could have just stayed home

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:25.299
And the students did succeed in shutting down the venue, so they could have declared a victory

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:30.730
But it's not a full victory unless he is physically off the campus

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:35.919
We can't have him speaking on campus because that defiles us that pollutes us

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.470
We must shut that down, and that's where I started saying wow this is like full-blown

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.910
psychology of religion, Durkheim, sanctity, purity, blasphemy

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:52.120
And that I think you know that doesn't describe most students that that describes a sort of the core those who

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:57.669
Really have their identities wrapped up in this movement. Okay, so so with disgust

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.330
I wanted to I wanted to ask you a couple things about that so you

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:09.190
Know the Big Five research into political differences basically shows that the liberals are high in trait openness and low on trait

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.440
Conscientiousness, and the Conservatives are the reverse

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:18.099
but we've fragmented conscientiousness into orderliness and industriousness with a Big Five aspect scale and

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.829
Orderliness is strongly associated with disgust

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.530
So so right, right?

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.140
Right exactly it does sound a lot like Freud

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:32.199
but it but it also is in accordance with your observations that conservatives have neater spaces for example, so

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.120
So now in-- and their meetings start on time-- yes, and yeah exactly right right so

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:45.460
So then the the nexus for political beliefs seems to be openness. So that's that exploratory tendency that you talked about

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.819
exploration of ideas and creativity and low

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:56.680
Orderliness and so then I thought well why in the world would why would the political nexus go across those dimensions which are some

00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:03.340
Relatively uncorrelated then I thought and this is in keeping with your work on disgust is that it's an issue of

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:08.919
Borders which of course seems more or less self-evident in the wake of Trump's election when he talked about borders

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.900
But you might say

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:16.420
And I think this is reasonable that the conservative is someone who wants the borders between

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.350
categories to remain intact no matter what level of analysis

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:27.399
so it's borders from the highest resolution level of cognition all the way up to the actual physical borders of

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.080
rooms, towns

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.710
States, countries all of that so the borders should be thicker and the reason they want that

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:40.059
Now there was a paper published in PLOS ONE. I don't know if you saw it it was a couple of years ago

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.350
It was a mind-boggling paper

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:48.399
It should have been like front page news as far as I was concerned and what the researchers did was between countries and then within

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:53.049
provinces or states within countries they correlated the level of

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.350
of

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:01.180
Frequency of infectious disease with authoritarian political beliefs and

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.569
Found a walloping correlation was like 0.6

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:09.759
It was one of the highest by that for those of you who don't know social scientists never discover anything

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.640
That's associated with anything else at a correlation of 0.6

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.700
Other than heritability right other than heritability yes

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.950
and so what they found was that the higher the prevalence of infectious disease the higher the probability of of

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:29.050
Totalitarian or authoritarian political attitudes, and then they controlled for governance because one of the questions was was this top-down

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:36.999
authoritarianism or bottom-up authoritarianism and the answer was that it was bottom-up okay, and so I thought about that in -

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.880
from two perspectives

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.530
Simultaneously at the time, okay, so we identified disgust sensitivity with orderliness

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:51.429
So it's a a fundamental sub trait, and I was reading this book that was called Hitler's Table Talk

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:58.629
And it was a it was the recordings of virtually everything he said at dinner from 1939 to 1942 - yeah

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.940
so it's a spontaneous utterance assay and

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:10.510
It's full of discussions about Jews and gypsies and all the people he tormented, but what's really interesting is all the language is disgust

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:16.359
It's not fear so so Hitler's basic metaphor was that the Aryan race

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.560
And country was a pure body and that it was assaulted by

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:26.290
Parasites right and then I remembered what happened to the Native Americans when the Europeans showed up and shook hands

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:33.999
What happened was that 95% of them were dead within 50 years right because of smallpox and measles and so that

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:39.940
That border issue that separates conservatives from liberals. Let's say as the Conservatives say

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:46.420
The novel is potentially contaminated. It's not so much that it's dangerous. That's different. That's fear

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:53.590
It's contaminating and the Liberals say hold on a minute if you make the borders too thick then information can't pass through. Exactly

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.729
So that's the Omnivore's Dilemma right there. Right right and and then since we have a biological

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.719
Architecture on which our cognitive platforms are erected

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:07.180
We have the same attitude towards abstract information, which would be ideas that we do to

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.620
things like food or illness

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:16.250
This right right and so we can think of an invading idea or a polluting idea or a contaminating idea. That's right. Now

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.589
I'm a big fan of George Lakoff, Metaphors We Live By

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.090
That we yeah

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.870
We use our bodily our

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:28.489
Bodily schemata to think about abstract things like politics and like what our policies should be about borders and immigration

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:35.809
There's a Canadian psychologist, Mark Schaller, he and his colleagues have developed what they call an account of these the behavioural immune system

00:22:35.809 --> 00:22:37.809
Yeah, right that we don't just try to you know

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:46.189
Microbes killed probably many more of our ancestors than did lions and tigers and bears and so whoever can keep themselves and their children

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:51.739
From being exposed to fatal illnesses wins the evolutionary game and so a lot of that is

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:59.030
Judging carefully about people is he dangerous, is she dangerous and that's both for sexuality, for contact, for all kinds of association

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:04.129
So yeah in a lot of ways our emotions and our bodily interactions structure

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.349
how we think and feel about about social interactions

00:23:06.809 --> 00:23:09.109
Well even with the black death in Europe

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:14.959
I mean so the black death occurred in Europe when the Europeans started to move around the world and they brought back rats that were

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:21.110
Infected exactly so so what you saw there was both of those forces at work at the same time so the European expansion

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.890
produced a tremendous

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.910
Interchange of ideas from all around the world that's globalization

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:30.109
But it wiped out somewhere between 30 and 60 percent of the population at the same time

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:36.439
So wouldn't it be good if in every society or every organization we had some people who specialized in

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:42.410
Specialized in saying "hey, what are the opportunities?" and then we had other people who specialized in saying "well

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:47.269
But what are the risks?" and it just so happens that a lot of people have trouble doing all that in themselves

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.290
When we have systems that are well constituted with people who have different

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:56.179
Personalities and different motives and goals we actually can get better outcomes. We can have a discussion between them

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:56.660
Yeah
well

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.020
That's exactly why that

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.229
it's it's for that precise reason that

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:06.559
That I've been so interested in free speech as a as a value because well even on the economic front

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:10.639
it's pretty obvious if you look at things economically that the

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:15.050
entrepreneur types who start businesses are lumped in with the liberal creative types

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:20.629
We've done a lot of work on the prediction of entrepreneurial behavior and ability and it's openness. That's the big predictor

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:24.719
It's not the only one its openness an IQ fundamentally but for managerial and administrative

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.700
expertise it's oh

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:32.460
It's IQ and conscientiousness so the Liberals start businesses and and but they can't run them

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:38.400
Because their their their interest's flipped, and they don't have the organizational ability and the Conservatives can run them

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.619
But they can't continue to transform and expand them it yin, and yang yin, and yang, yeah

00:24:44.289 --> 00:24:45.970
so so

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.059
One more thing about what happened in Nazi Germany

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:53.580
That that's very relevant and interesting because it's it's useful to get these motives right you know

00:24:53.919 --> 00:24:59.669
first of all if if something disgusts you if something if you're afraid of something then you run away from it or you freeze

00:24:59.799 --> 00:25:05.399
But if something disgusts you you try to burn it or kill it right you try to get rid of it or

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.390
Expel it that's that's right though. You want to get it away and destroy it

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:13.020
What so when Hitler first came to power he

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:18.059
Put in a bunch of public health schemes like he had vans that went around and screen people for tuberculosis

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.230
then he went on a

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:21.730
factory cleanliness

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.409
campaign

00:25:23.409 --> 00:25:25.979
So the factories were supposed to be tidied up

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:32.159
And he washed, he bathed about four times a day by the way, he was also a great worshipper of willpower which is associated with

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.620
Orderliness and seems maybe to be associated with disgust sensitivity in some way that isn't yet understood

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:38.890
Yeah, yeah

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.339
I don't I don't understand that connection either

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:49.260
so they he convinced factory owners in Germany to get rid of the rats and the mite and mice and the and the

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.380
Insects in the factories and also to clean them up and beautify them

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.099
But the gas they used to clean up the factories was Zyklon-A and

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:59.400
It was the variation of that gas, Zyklon-B

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.989
That was then used in yeah, so you could see this ramping up, eh. So it was yeah absolutely

00:26:04.539 --> 00:26:06.959
So it was public health, then it was

00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:11.309
Social cleanliness, then he went into the asylums and cleaned them up

00:26:11.309 --> 00:26:16.619
And so it was just this expansion of of who was contaminated and who was impure

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:24.329
and I think also his fascination with fire and his use of fire symbolism was also associated with that with that appeal to

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:30.239
purification because the whole idea of purification by fire is a very ancient idea so

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.289
okay, so

00:26:32.289 --> 00:26:37.199
so how did your work on disgust change the way that you looked at things

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.580
Fundamentally, I mean you gave some indication of that already, but what else has it changed

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.510
so

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.510
since I was coming out of a

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.099
Psychological literature that was very focused on on sort of secular

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:56.430
secular ethics about justice and fairness, and then I began studying disgust and

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:00.209
Looking at the broader moral domain that almost all societies have

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:06.390
That then also led me to think about well. Okay, if disgust is a reaction to things that seem to be

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:12.690
Degrading so an interesting element of disgust is this notion of degradation there are always these vertical metaphors

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:19.139
In which disgust brings us down and and disgust it so a lot of some religious practice and Judaism and Islam

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.400
and and Hinduism is about preparing your body to approach God and

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:30.240
Purification and so that led me to think well if there's an emotion which is about seeing our lower, base or animal

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:37.259
Biological nature is there an opposite emotion is there an emotion of that we feel when we see some manifestation or a higher

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:42.779
Nobler nature, and I was just beginning to think this when I moved to UVA. I got my first job at the University of Virginia

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:49.979
1995 and I read the set of Thomas Jefferson's letters and in one letter he describes

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.209
He describes the feelings you get from reading great fiction

00:27:54.580 --> 00:28:00.209
He advises a cousin of his that he should buy fiction for his library. Not just you know serious works of law and philosophy

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.099
And he described he says doesn't he describe the feeling of

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:12.690
Of having your sentiments be elevated does it not dilate your breast, give you an open feeling in your chest

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:17.700
When you see these acts of beauty and kindness and gratitude. I thought wow that's exactly it

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:24.810
And so because I've been studying disgust. I then started studying its opposite, which I and some others called moral elevations

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:32.549
So there's kind of vertical metaphor of elevation and degradation-- maps onto the body too with regards to-- that's right high, low

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.900
clean, dirty

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:42.749
yeah, it's a beautiful pairing and so having this language of elevation and disgust just really has helped me see a lot of things I

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.989
Just I could just see a lot of things happening it allows me to like

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:50.580
even you know manipulate like if I'm applying for a grant proposal like I get very good at like having an

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.770
elevating ending you know to

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.120
to end with a notable uplift

00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:02.109
And so it just broadened, it just broadened by thinking about morality and this was around 1995 and so again

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.920
It just prepared me so that

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.830
And I'd already been to India by that point I spent three months doing research in Orissa in eastern India

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.789
So it just broadened my thinking and that's what allowed me

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:19.989
Finally to understand conservatives because I had always been on the left. I hated Ronald Reagan

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.740
I

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:28.280
Thought Republicans were stupid and evil and it was only when I'd gone to India and really tried to understand a traditional

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.320
religious

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.509
Hierarchical, gender stratified society tried to understand it in their terms

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:39.160
They didn't try to just bring in my own my own Western left. You know left-leaning perspectives

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:46.180
That I was and this was all under the guidance of Richard Shweder, my postdoc supervisor at the University of Chicago, where I did a postdoc

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:48.910
It was only then that I was able to

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:54.760
Sort of get inside their minds and their moral system and see that there were alternative moral worlds

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.719
They each had their own logic and that was the metaphor I came to it. You know the time

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:03.549
You know The Matrix movies were very popular so the metaphor, The Matrix as a consensual hallucination

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:08.109
Made a lot of sense. It's waking up with the idea of just speaking with moral matrices

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.479
Which every different moral matrices. That are grounded in biology

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:15.430
They're biology in the sense that gives us the potential it's like the building blocks of this matrix

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.219
Can't be just anything that comes it comes from our

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:26.020
experiences our embodied experiences and again George Lakoff is the master of that thinking and so it was only then that

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:31.360
that I was able to now listen to conservative talk radio and

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:38.559
Christian religious radio and see rather than just saying oh those stupid terrible people say like oh wow yeah

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:43.869
You know I can see that they're striving for a certain virtues. Right right so you started to understand their metaphorical language essentially

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:47.739
That's right, and that was like kind of like my you know I know great awakening or scales falling from my eyes

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.039
But you know since well it took a few more you took a number of a lot more years

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.330
But eventually I kind of just like pulled out the implants from my eyes

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.729
And I stopped seeing everything so through a partisan lens

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:02.410
And I'm not on any side now and just trying to understand what the hell is well. It's really useful

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:05.060
It's really useful to understand that there are

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:10.580
Actual reasons why people see the world differently and that you can't just easily say that one is right

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.730
and the other is wrong because

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:16.939
The Liberals are correct when it comes to borders that if you thicken them too much and diminish the information flow

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.600
You risk making the society so static that any radical

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.960
Environmental transformation will sink it it's the case

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.659
But the Conservatives are right in that you pay a big price

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:31.429
with regards to newcomers and new information with regards to risk to exposure to

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.730
contaminating, well to contamination period but also to

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.050
contaminating ideas and so then I've always thought you know the the

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:45.350
Environment itself moves back and forth like a snake in some sense and what we're trying to do is stay on the center of its

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:47.870
back
And the only way we can do that is by people

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:52.519
By having people pull to the right and say be careful and people pull to the left and say well

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.330
Yeah
but be open with that dialogue and the the

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:03.560
exchange of information that that dialogue allows we can maybe specify the center of that moving target and stay and stay

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.520
Well and stay on the back

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.420
Yeah, okay, so that's a really complicated metaphor with the snake

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:14.779
But I think it's a perfect way in to what's going on on campus and to why viewpoint diversity is so important because that's I

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.179
agree exactly with what you just said and

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:25.100
So what I the view that I've come to in studying moral psychology, is that we is that humans are

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.620
ultra social Apes

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:32.539
We we evolved to live in these small groups that are fighting with each other

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:41.419
We evolved to have these low-level animistic religions. That's our steady state. That's the way we were for at least 100,000 years or much more

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.180
probably closer to a million in some form

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.480
So that's sort of our design. That's what we were designed for in a sense

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.350
and

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:55.669
In that sense where as individuals were really kind of stupid tribal creatures designed to do post hoc reasoning

00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:03.110
But if you put us together in the right way with the right checks with the right the right systems

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:08.750
The the whole can be vastly smarter than the components that go into it

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:13.489
Which is true of the brain - the brain is composed of neurons each neurons really kind of a stupid little switch

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:18.069
But you put them together in the right way, and you get something really brilliant and in the same way

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:22.779
I don't know all the history here, but my understanding is that science begins or

00:33:23.419 --> 00:33:26.979
the culture of science the scientific revolution begins in Europe

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:33.399
In the 17th century as you begin getting you get the printing press so people can share their ideas

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.879
but you get communities of people who are challenging each other's ideas and

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.590
That's what makes it so brilliant is that is that people have to do their best

00:33:41.779 --> 00:33:43.989
We're really bad at disconfirming our own ideas

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:47.740
It's very hard to make it's very hard to do that, but you put your ideas out there and then

00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:54.818
Everyone else is motivated to challenge them and so if you put us together in the right way the truth comes out and so adversarial

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.480
systems of law

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.480
Journalists know this they have to listen to both sides

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:03.579
Scientists know this social scientists should know this okay, what happened well

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:08.229
The Academy has has always leaned left in the 20th century

00:34:08.899 --> 00:34:10.899
But leaning isn't the problem

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:17.859
So people think oh viewpoint diversity. We need we need everybody we need Nazis. We need every view. No we don't need everybody

00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:20.289
What we need is no orthodoxy

00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:21.829
That's what's fatal

00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:22.579
orthodoxy

00:34:22.579 --> 00:34:26.139
so if you have if you have to field like sociology or

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:32.319
Social psychology in which it's two or three to one left to right that's totally fine with me. That's totally fine

00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:37.149
Because if someone makes some claim, that's just like ideologically blind

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:43.479
Someone will say you know common sense other evidence that you've missed and then the system works

00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:48.039
But what what I learned when I started down this road in 2011 I gave a talk

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.709
at a big conference of social psychologists

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:55.000
I gave a talk about this problem that we're losing our diversity that I

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:59.319
Could only find one conservative in the entire field. I gave a talk on this

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.900
and

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:04.460
And

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.460
So what I've learned since then is that

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:13.509
The ratio in psychology was between two to one and four to one left-right all the way up to the early 90s

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:17.169
We've gathered together all the studies we could find so all the way up to the early 90s

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.659
It's only three or four to one left or right which would be okay?

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:26.020
but then between 1995 or four and 2010 it goes to

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:32.199
14 to 1. You do you have any idea why and why that time? Yes, so

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.319
So you get the same story whether you look at

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.760
republican-democrat ratios or liberal-conservative

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:42.159
They're they tell the same story so the two the big things going on there are one

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.579
Is that the Greatest Generation which had a lot of Republicans

00:35:46.309 --> 00:35:51.759
so a lot of men go off to World War Two, they they're on the GI Bill they enter the Academy in the

00:35:52.039 --> 00:35:54.549
1950s a lot of them are conservative or republican

00:35:55.549 --> 00:35:56.900
So you have a lot of them

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:02.470
but in the 60s and 70s one of the main reasons to go to grad school in the social sciences is either a)

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:08.770
To stay in school to escape the Vietnam War draft or b) to fight for social justice and against racism

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.280
so in sociology and psychology in particular in political science

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:17.589
Maybe I'm not sure you get a huge influx of left-leaning people who are there to pursue

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:23.230
Social justice, so you know the motives are fine, and if it was balanced to be totally fine

00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:24.530
but

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:28.449
As you get these young junior people on the Left come in in the 70s and 80s

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:32.349
And then you get the older people that are more politically balanced retiring in the 80s and 90s

00:36:32.599 --> 00:36:37.538
By the time you get to the late 90s, it's all Baby Boomers. And so do you get a

00:36:37.539 --> 00:36:41.739
Do you get a positive feedback loop developing in there? Like you said it's like three to one

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:42.349
It's okay

00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:47.379
But maybe when it hits four to one it goes to like twenty to one? Then you said exactly so you so

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:51.430
Then you start getting hostile climate so I wrote a review paper on this with

00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:56.019
with Joe Duarte and Phil Tetlock and Lee Jussim, Jarret Crawford

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.020
and

00:36:59.089 --> 00:37:00.920
And we

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.819
So we reviewed everything that we could find we concluded that

00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:09.339
Most of what's going on is self selection that is people on the Left, and we're open to experience they're always gonna

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:14.439
Get self selection, but then there's really good evidence that there's also hostile climate

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:19.149
I mean, it's it's undeniable now that if you are not on the left in a grad program

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:24.910
There's just constant little subtle or not so subtle reminders that you don't belong and look in the Academy

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:30.250
We're all about saying hey, if there are subtle hints here and there you can't succeed right

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:33.909
I mean, that's what we do for a living is we say that little things will stop people

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.719
Well little things are put in the way of anyone who doesn't fit politically

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.470
And so you do get hostile climate you do get overt discrimination

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.539
There's evidence of that and then there is also

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:50.290
It is part of the story here that what it means to be a conservative in the 90s and especially two thousands has changed so

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.220
It is true that

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:56.139
You know that that conservatives were not in any way anti-science

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:02.589
until much more recent times now actually all sides are anti science about different Sciences, but

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:07.389
in America the the right wing the Republican Party had

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:08.860
it's controversial

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:14.650
But I do believe that the polarization starts with the right moving further out so what it means to be concerned to be anti anti

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:18.460
Evolutionary which is actually what's happening on the left now - exactly that's yeah

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:23.859
So well-- postmodern left-- I talked to Bret Weinstein the other day, and you know he one of his claims is that

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:29.799
Evolutionary biology has something in it to offend everyone, so it's a it's a science

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.350
That's very likely to be targeted by extremists

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:36.370
you also brought up something that actually touches on the I on the

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:42.190
Difficult problem of how it is that you might define someone who's ideologically possessed

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:46.059
Let's say or ideologically rigid because the idea was that you

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:48.789
Can make a valid case for the utility of

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.820
free

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.960
information flow and

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:56.259
and the free flow of people that would go along with that and you can make a good case for the danger of that and

00:38:56.330 --> 00:39:02.200
So the idea might be that if you're only making a case for the danger of that then you're tilted too far to the right

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.159
And if you're only making a case for the utility of that then you're tilted too far to the left

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:11.710
Exactly, that's right, and so we can look at immigration as a nice example. There was a recent essay in the Atlantic

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.710
I think it was by Peter Beinart

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:15.830
Where he

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.150
He reviews

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:20.740
it starts with a lot of quotes that are pretty nuanced positions about

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:24.549
immigration from Barack Obama, Paul Krugman and a bunch of other people on the Left

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:27.460
Who used to be able to say on the one hand you know

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:34.869
Compassion, economic on the other hand you know we have to have a legal process, and there's a threat to low-wage workers

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:40.720
so people on the Left used to be ale to talk about immigration and talk about the pros and cons the pluses and minuses but

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:46.269
Beinart shows how in the last four or five years you can't if you so much as suggests that well maybe

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:54.279
Immigration is a net good, but it might have some deleterious effects on certain classes of low-wage American workers

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:56.090
You could get in big trouble

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:58.130
Right because that's instantly prejudicial

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:03.589
You know because immigration has become a sacred topic so this is the key thing that I want everyone to keep in mind

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:11.090
We are fundamentally religious creatures, we're built for religion and it's a great achievement to create a scientific

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.929
Establishment and an academic establishment that keeps that way of thinking out

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:22.519
scientific thinking is not natural thinking religious thinking is natural thinking and what's happening to us in the last few years especially is a

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.210
flooding in of

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:28.399
Religious thinking and so let's get a bunch of social scientists to talk about immigration

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:35.720
What are they going to do look at the data, weigh up the pluses and minuses? No they're going to many of them feel

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:43.699
They're on a team and that team is fighting the right the right is anti-immigrant it includes racist elements therefore that justifies us in

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:46.070
being Pro immigration and

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:52.519
Social Sciences are always there's always ambiguity. There's always conflicting studies. Yes, there's multiple causal factors

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:57.050
And there are always in a social science study. That's right so Beinart's point was that

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:01.640
The left used to be able to think straight about immigration clearly it had a you know

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.039
It's generally Pro immigration, but it used to be able to think straight

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:08.989
But in the last few years a religious Orthodox mindset has overtaken it

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:14.659
Okay
So we might as well also point out that it's a primordial religious mindset right because I mean there are

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.880
I don't mean Christian or Jewish I mean

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.900
ancient, tribal

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:24.680
small-scale lots of gods. Right right well so then one of the things that you might suggest is that when you throw out a

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.039
sophisticated religious structure an unsophisticated

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.540
Religious structure comes in to fill the gap. I do so that's true. Okay

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:39.019
Definitely worth thinking about so. That's right, so that's right the thing with religions. We have to clarify

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:46.340
Fundamentalism is the problem not religion, and so-- it's close to tribalism. That's right if you get a fundamentalist

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:50.509
You know I'm happy to say and if you have people applying to a grad program in psychology

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:56.959
And I find out that they're Christian that's fine. There's no problem, but if they're fundamentalist Christian

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.439
I would think well let's say let's say it's not psychology suppose. It's you know

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.040
geology

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:06.649
So someone applies to a geology program they are a fundamentalist Young Earth Creationist

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:14.599
Are you gonna admit them? No. I don't think you should they're not able to do the right kind of thinking based on

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.829
What we know to be the case, they're-- They're not in the scientific paradigm-- Not the scientific, that's right

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:23.809
So so if we wouldn't admit a fundamentalist Christian to a geology program

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:29.539
why would we admit someone who is just as fundamentalist about certain moral and political issues into a

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:36.590
Sociology program or into a psychology program if they come in knowing what the right answer is committed to that right answer

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:43.100
likely to get angry at anyone who contravenes that right answer and and

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:47.509
Showing signs of closed-mindedness, I don't think they belong in a grad program-- Yeah

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:51.979
I guess the question is how in the world do you set up mechanisms to ensure that you're not

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:54.120
swamped by

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:59.180
Fundamentalists of any sort so those are people who are reducing everything to a single cause it's something like that

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:05.780
How can you implement a structure that protects the organization against that without the structure itself becoming

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:10.670
Totalitarian you know because these things these things spin out of control so fast. Yeah

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:17.750
But so you know, I think what we have to realize in the Academy is that we face. I think we face an existential crisis

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:24.799
We rely an enormous amount on public goodwill, we get enormous tax subsidies

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:27.830
direct research support and

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:29.940
recent polling shows that

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:34.789
While Democrats have always had a higher opinion of the universities than Republicans until two years ago

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:40.759
Everybody thought universities are a good thing. They make life better so Americans have been very supportive of higher education

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.440
They're been rising gripes on the right

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.890
But it's only between

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:50.390
2015 and 2017 that now Republicans go from saying mostly universities are good things in two years

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:55.729
They go way down and say the universes are bad things. They're making things worse now. How is this news greeted?

00:43:56.970 --> 00:44:04.970
Pundits on the Left are us that oh those Republicans are so anti science look how ignorant. They are they now hate universities

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:12.680
Come on. Anybody who's been watching the news anybody who's seen the mobs, the shout-downs to the illiberal behavior

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:14.840
You know the metaphor I use is like you know

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.560
Americans on the right and left are

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:21.950
really supportive of the military we have it's one of the few institutions that we still hold in high esteem on both sides and

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:25.810
So the Republicans more than Democrats, so suppose you had Gallup poll

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:29.860
And I showing Republicans like the military more than Democrats but both really liked it

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:36.759
Then suddenly in 2015 we started seeing video from all over military bases and military

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.880
Academies in which the military leaders are overtly right-wing they're there

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.880
They're saying terrible things about

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:52.959
Leftists and progressives and the Midshipmen and the cadets and everybody is mobbing the occasional liberal and they're behaving in a really despicable

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:55.060
scary and intimidating way

00:44:55.190 --> 00:45:00.130
What do you think the left would now think about the military obviously support for the military would plummet

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:06.669
That's what's happening in America with universities. We are losing the support of half the country. This is unsustainable

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.270
Especially in red states where you know they control the purse strings

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:13.419
So I think we have a major crisis

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.400
I think we've got to go into crisis mode

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:20.229
And we've got to clean up our act so just as we're doing in psychology with Replication Project

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.699
We recognize that our methods weren't good enough, and we're doing a crash course

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:30.160
Thanks to Brian Nosek and others, The OpenScience Project. We're really trying to improve our game. Thank God

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:36.219
We need to I think we have to do the exact same thing about partisanship and our [???] Okay

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:42.490
So let's talk about Heterodox Academy because you set that up this organization that you should tell everybody about in in

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:47.049
Precisely to deal with this issue, and so I'd like I'd like to know about it

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:52.900
How it's growing what it's doing what your aims are all of that. So I gave this talk in 2011 laying out

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:59.439
the fact that we have no more conservatives in social psychology, and why this makes it hard for us to find truth and

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:04.000
In the months after that a few social psychologists resonated with the message

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.630
They said wow I think that I think you're right. I have some data on this so the five of us

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:10.510
Or six of us

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:14.140
Wrote this paper. It came out in Behavioral and Brain Sciences

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:17.739
Oh, Charlotta Stern, I'm sorry was the sixth one that I forgot to add in before

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:22.029
We got this paper published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences. It came out

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:24.130
It was sort of online in 2014

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:30.610
But it came out for good in the summer 2015 which coincidentally was the same summer that my article came out with Greg Lukianoff

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:34.900
Called The Coddling of the American Mind that was about things going on with undergrads

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:40.689
But our concern was entirely faculty was just the nature of the academic community the research community

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.359
So we got these two things going on summer 2015

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:50.500
And then that summer I hear from Nick Rosencrantz a law professor who says we have the same problem in law

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:56.349
Is worse in law well, it's really bad in Canada, in law. Okay, because and as he points out

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.539
We're training all these students

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:05.619
They never meet a conservative then they have to go argue cases in front of judges half of whom were appointed by Republicans

00:47:05.619 --> 00:47:08.318
They have no idea. What a conservative thinks this is malpractice

00:47:08.319 --> 00:47:12.249
We got a train so say and I hear from a sociologist Chris Martin same thing of

00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:14.409
Sociology so the three of us said hey you know

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:20.530
This is a big problem for the whole academy-- Have you looked at faculties of Education? Oh my God, those are the worst, by worst

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:21.549
I don't know the numbers

00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:29.169
But in terms of the vindictiveness that the incred the pressure put on any non-conforming opinion my impression

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:34.659
I don't of data, but my impression from the letters I get is that education schools and social work school

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:39.250
Yeah, are the worst that's exactly in keeping with my my understanding as well

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:41.260
It's hard to tell which of those two are worst

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:48.189
I would say it's the faculties of Education because they have a direct pipeline to kids. Oh, in terms of their effects. Yes far more pernicious

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:52.899
Yeah, yes, yeah, but but equally equally warped let's say but but more pernicious

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:58.809
And and the things that are happening in the Canadian education system as a consequence of that are so reprehensible it-- We should get to that

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:03.879
Because it's happening here too with these ideas filtering down to high school. I've been so focused on college now

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.170
We're discovering the problem is actually baked in the illiberal attitudes are often baked in

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:16.389
Yes, and purposefully like in in Canada increasingly the the radical leftists have control over curriculum development

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:20.770
And they're starting to develop social justice curriculums, which is what they call them

00:48:21.529 --> 00:48:26.829
For kindergarten kids so it's really it's been another get back through the earlier grades

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:30.129
So so the originally three of us decided to put up a website

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:33.069
I invited all the other authors from the the BBS paper

00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:39.429
We invited a few other people working on this and so for the first year we had this project, it was called heterodoxacademy.org

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:43.420
We put the site up on about September 10th. I think it was

00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:48.909
2015 and it was just a community of researchers who are studying

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:55.890
the problem of the lack of viewpoint diversity, well five days later the protests start at Missouri, so these are

00:48:56.499 --> 00:48:59.219
racially motivated protests or protests about racial

00:49:00.009 --> 00:49:02.399
insensitivity and racial problems at Missouri

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:07.199
And at first it seemed like this is just a Missouri problem, but coming in the wake of course of

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.879
Ferguson and all the videos we saw of unarmed black men being killed by police

00:49:12.519 --> 00:49:17.159
The a lot of his concerns spread to other universities the protests aren't just about race

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.909
But it was that fall of 2015 especially the Yale protest

00:49:21.369 --> 00:49:26.969
When the president of Yale validates their narrative that Yale's are racist place we have to reform Yale

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.700
Then it spreads nationally and now suddenly

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:34.079
This is not just a faculty issue anymore so even though at Heterodox Academy we mostly focus on the faculty

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.180
We're now seeing it's a complex ecosystem

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:42.029
With all kinds of forces acting on universities so that between 2015 and 2017

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.619
the danger of

00:49:44.619 --> 00:49:51.538
Speaking honestly about what you think about an academic or intellectual proposition has skyrocketed the risk of being mobbed

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:57.300
Ostracized, formally investigated-- by Title IX people for example-- By Title IX people

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:02.880
Here we're sitting here at NYU, go to any bathroom. I'll show you on this floor go to any bathroom

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:08.700
There's a sign telling students exactly what number to call to report you or me if we say something that is

00:50:08.859 --> 00:50:15.328
That someone takes to be a biased act. Oh, so you have bias you have bias investigation teams here. That's right

00:50:15.329 --> 00:50:18.808
See we haven't got to that point that particular point in Canada yet

00:50:18.809 --> 00:50:23.579
So I think we're farther ahead down that path in some ways, but not quite as far in others

00:50:23.609 --> 00:50:27.328
Yeah, that's really that's really unbelievable. So things are changing very very fast

00:50:27.329 --> 00:50:30.629
It's not at all schools, but then again things are changing so fast

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:35.069
We don't really know we don't have good data on what's going on what I can tell you though is that

00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:38.399
At Heterodox Academy when we started out in 2015

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:43.410
There was a lot of suspicion a lot of people on the Left were afraid like oh is this some

00:50:43.599 --> 00:50:46.349
Right-wing group now very few of us are actually on the right

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:52.859
But because we end up mostly speaking up for libertarians and conservatives who are attacked or silenced

00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:57.988
You know people will think oh, we must be right-wing, but we're not I mean I'm I've never voted for Republican in my life

00:50:57.989 --> 00:50:59.989
I've never given money to a Republican campaign

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:05.190
I'm now increasingly calling myself a liberal now that we see a illiberalism flourishing

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:10.319
But so when we started out there was a lot of suspicion of us from

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:17.310
Many professors, but now that it's clear that the problems these are not just a few anecdotes. This is the new normal

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:21.329
And it's not just in the Universities as you pointed out. That's right. It's already

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:27.239
It's like mad. And it's not just in the U.S. It's spread when in 2015 I thought it was uniquely American problem

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:31.260
Yeah, boy, it's in Canada and the UK and it is really what New Zealand that's right

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:33.749
It is a uniquely Anglosphere problem. This is really interesting

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:37.380
It's not on the continent very much at all. What about in the Nordic countries? No

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:42.809
I mean they have so political correctness you have lots of places the unique thing that

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:47.789
Identifies this new culture is linking the political correctness with the sense of fragility

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:51.629
And this is something America's pioneered the idea that

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:54.330
So in Britain they've always had

00:51:54.910 --> 00:52:00.749
No platforming they call it so if there's an, there was an there's a British National Party, an actual fascist party

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:06.180
You know so if a if a BNP member is gonna speak on campus you mob him you shut it down no plat...

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:08.250
Don't give a platform, so you know you've had

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.930
Passionate politics certainly since the 60s so that's not new and that's everywhere

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:20.609
What's new is the American idea that if someone says something and it could be a sincerely expressed idea

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:25.860
Not a racist rant just like well. I don't know I think that maybe hormones do affect gendered behavior

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:32.790
Can you say that? Well what if someone takes that as as somehow

00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:41.340
essentializing gender and then saying that women are inferior or whatever if they. Yes, well, that happened to James Damore, for exact exactly exactly so

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:46.319
So, that's what's new is the idea that if someone says something that

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:53.010
Someone a member of a protected or marginalized group is offended by that person is harmed. If that person is harmed

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:59.219
We must protect that person and more ominously just in the last year or two. It's not just that they're harming their suffering

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:02.370
It's that this was violent. Yes, right violence well

00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:03.460
That's part of the postmodern

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:09.030
Narratives that attribute everything to power-- this is so dangerous the the crossing the line into into violence

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.960
It just occurred to me

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:15.150
Just like yesterday was thinking about this wait the state is supposed to have a monopoly on violence, right

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:20.760
But if speech especially his speech and her speech and the people the speech of those people in that academic

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:27.060
movement or on the and that if their speech is violence well the state is supposed to have a monopoly on their speech then and

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:30.810
And if it's violence well

00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:33.120
Then we have a right to use violence back

00:53:33.370 --> 00:53:38.249
The state doesn't have a monopoly on our violence because our violence is you know it's morally motivated

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.560
so just the Orwellian and

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:48.000
Authoritarian implications of this move once you say that speech is violence you're unlocking you know you're opening Pandora's box

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.320
I mean you're you're five steps down the road to hell and I'd say we're about seven steps down the road

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:58.919
Okay you so you're or you're that concerned about it. Okay, so now tell me how many how many members

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:02.100
If you don't have to discuss any of this obviously

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:08.669
But how many members of Heterodox Academy are there now? We have 1,300 members so once we opened up it's originally

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:14.280
It was just four researchers who were studying this problem, but we had lots of people wanting to join and so we said well

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.310
Okay, why not and so we just said alright if as long as you're a professor

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:24.059
That is you have a PhD you're living more or less the life of a professor you have a university affiliation so we now take

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.140
adjuncts if they have a PhD

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:32.939
We take postdocs basically if you're in the guild if you're living the life of a professor and you're concerned about

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.640
the

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:43.289
Rise of intimidation frankly if you're concerned that our wonderful institution, I love I love being a professor

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:50.640
I love hmm, and I feel like it's not just losing public respect. It's losing its ability to to function

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:54.239
It's losing its ability to teach and do research on politicized topics

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:59.370
There are more politicized topics all the time. That's right, and there are few in the natural science

00:54:59.370 --> 00:54:59.790
It's not many

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:04.679
But there are some in the Natural Sciences as well anyway my point is we're now growing very rapidly and something

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.680
I'm very excited by is

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:10.499
Since we've started having more of violence on campus with beginning with Berkeley and Middlebury

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:17.909
we're seeing a pervasive sense among people on the left that there really is this problem here that something has to be done and

00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.819
So we are finding much more acceptance now

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:24.870
From professors on the left so I like to think about there's the liberal left

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:26.520
Yeah, just the great majority

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:32.429
And there's the illiberal left. We did a factor analysis of politically correct beliefs and found exactly that

00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:39.149
And that the and that the illiberal left was also high in orderliness-- That's interesting, that's the authoritarian-- Exactly

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.140
and also

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.140
kind of markedly decline

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:49.200
Was also characterized by a marked lack of verbal intelligence. That's yeah it

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:55.320
The correlation was about 0.4-- Well that oh, that's beautiful. That's beautiful because one of the simplest formulations

00:55:55.320 --> 00:56:00.420
I've heard were the great formulation from Mark Lilla so Mark Lilla wrote this fantastic op-ed the New York Times

00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:05.309
A week after Trump was elected saying identity politics is a really foolish thing to do

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:10.589
It pushes lots of people over to Trump's side, the identity politics is part of the problem well

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:13.710
He writes this op-ed and one of his fellow professors at Columbia

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:17.489
I forget how she does it, but she basically says something about that

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:22.860
you know the the mask with eyeholes falls from his face like you know he's a Ku Klux Klan member something like that and

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:27.360
So Lilla, Lilla who is in the humanities, he's an intellectual historian

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:34.529
Lilla has this simple formulation. He says that's a slur not an argument and once I had that simple formulation

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:40.590
I realized wow that's almost all the pushback I've ever gotten it's somehow. You know

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:45.479
Oh, you know you're winking at Nazi's or you are-- Yeah, that's happened to me over and over

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:52.050
I was just my neighborhood was just posters with-- I saw that get the intimidation so so this is really key

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:54.300
We're supposed to be all about

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:59.069
you can say anything you want you can make any argument you want if you can support it if

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.679
You can back it with reasons. This is critical thinking

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:05.909
This is what we're supposed to train our students to do. Well, and it's not only that you can say anything

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:06.910
But you can say it

00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:11.430
There's a boundary on that which especially if you're a scientist less so in the humanities

00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:18.239
But if you're a scientist the things you say have to be vetted by people who are going to be critical of them right so

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:23.010
So not only not only is a new facility. That works is accountability. That's built into it. That's right

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:25.499
So I didn't mean to say you can say you know are racist rant

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:30.120
I mean you can put forth any idea you want if you can back it up what we're seeing

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:38.189
with anything politicized is it's not about backing it up students are learning rhetorical techniques to link their enemies to

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:42.340
Something racist as-- Well something contemptible, something contaminated-- Something disgusting

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:47.080
You bet and that and that and those are the things that are not only worthy of being destroyed

00:57:47.099 --> 00:57:51.568
But that you have a moral duty to destroy that's-- Oh, that's right, so it's almost like the immune system

00:57:51.569 --> 00:57:52.739
Yeah, I don't know exactly how it works

00:57:52.739 --> 00:57:56.009
but there's some cell that tags a cell as

00:57:56.410 --> 00:58:01.769
You know enemy enemy and once that tag is put on the cell that attracts other I don't know

00:58:01.769 --> 00:58:05.399
What kind of cell to it-- Yeah, mob it so we should look into this this metaphor of the immune system

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.160
Yeah, because you know once they once you're labeled as a racist

00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:13.768
Students don't have to read you that it doesn't matter what you actually say you will now be attacked. Well

00:58:13.769 --> 00:58:20.039
It's also too that once you're labeled that way if someone defends you the label is contagious, right?

00:58:21.039 --> 00:58:28.948
In exactly the same manner-- That's how we know we're in this super-religious territory of witch-hunts that if you stand up for someone you are tagged and then you

00:58:28.948 --> 00:58:31.720
will be mobbed. Right and that's an infectious disease

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:35.040
Exactly, That's why there's so much cowardice on campus among both students and faculty

00:58:35.739 --> 00:58:41.039
People are afraid to stand up even if the majority think that what's going on is nuts or is

00:58:41.619 --> 00:58:49.468
Unfair they're afraid to stand up and that's in part due to social media because it's just I mean students today have been raised with

00:58:50.709 --> 00:58:54.839
Various platforms that make it easy for people to join in attack someone

00:58:54.839 --> 00:59:01.169
They look at who liked what so if in that article. We just saw on Reed there was a bit of a counter-revolution at Reed

00:59:01.989 --> 00:59:04.649
The students had to get together somehow and decide

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:10.349
Should I like that post how about we all like it at the same time then we'll get in less trouble, okay like. Okay

00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:16.619
So to what degree, so let's talk about the aims of the Heterodox Academy, so you've brought people together who are in

00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:19.029
principle interested in a

00:59:19.029 --> 00:59:26.099
Diversity of opinions and but but in what manner is that going to be utilized to - - I

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:33.659
don't want to use the word combat but - but to deal with this emergent problem of ideological rigidity in the universities? Yeah, so

00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:36.329
Two useful concepts here one is The Emperor's New Clothes

00:59:36.849 --> 00:59:38.769
We all know that story

00:59:38.769 --> 00:59:43.379
Even if most people even if everybody sees this is nuts the Emperor's walking around with no clothes

00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:47.940
They're afraid to say it until one person says it so and this is also the Asch experiment

00:59:48.489 --> 00:59:51.509
Everybody says that that line is the same as that line. It's obviously not true

00:59:51.509 --> 00:59:56.728
If one person says the truth then nobody conforms after that

00:59:56.979 --> 00:59:59.849
So the mere presence of a group of people who say you know

01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:03.539
But we actually need a diversity of opinions and the fact that on our site

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:07.170
We'll publish things so sometimes when professors are mobbed like when Bret Weinstein

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:11.460
You know was mobbed you know so I wrote an essay that stood up for him. We've done it for some of them

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:15.299
It's happening so fast. I can't keep up. I can't I've got books to write like you know every week

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:20.100
There's some new members getting mobbed and so we're gonna develop a team of people who will write

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.559
But just knowing that there are people who will stand up for you

01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:26.370
Knowing that there are people who will say wait a second

01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:28.960
You know this is not what we do in the Academy

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:34.169
So that's one thing is we just stand up for each other. Um two is we develop products that

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:37.440
We think can basically fix the situation

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.159
So one of our products is called the campus expression survey

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:48.149
It's a survey designed to actually measure who was afraid of speaking up about what topics and why what are they afraid of?

01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:51.329
And it turns out everyone's afraid of the students more than the faculty

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:57.749
They're afraid to mostly to talk about race-- What about the administrators? Everyone's afraid of the students. They're afraid of the students.

01:00:57.750 --> 01:01:03.690
Oh, so I don't have we've not so made them. I've only surveyed students. I don't okay, okay, but from what we hear

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:07.940
People are afraid of of the students

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:15.060
That's also appalling in its own manner like was that Reed where-- It's a failure of leadership, yeah-- that's for sure

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:21.719
They let those kids come into the classroom the actual classroom and disrupt a class on an ongoing basis. I mean-- For months--

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:27.330
Yes, and I couldn't understand that exactly I mean my response to that would be

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:31.529
First I would tell them to leave second I would call campus security

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.870
Third if something wasn't done about it

01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:35.110
I just wouldn't teach the class

01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:40.289
So I don't understand like it seems to me that it's also up to individual professors to draw a line

01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:46.080
Which is that if you're being intimidated by students, why do you why do you show up and teach the class?

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.140
I don't understand that-- Yeah, so um again

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:53.459
People are afraid to stand up if it means that people will call you a racist

01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:57.150
Yeah, but God. I mean it's it's weird in that situation though-- It's carried to an absurd--

01:01:57.150 --> 01:02:03.029
You're also afraid to go to your class you know and there's a much more proximal threat there

01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:07.950
That's what I mean. That's what I'm most alarmed by is the rise of intimidation intimidation is now a

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:12.219
In many aspects of academic life, and that's just terrible that's completely incompatible

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:19.989
With what we do and who we are. What's especially it's especially appalling given that whatever happens in the university campuses

01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:25.270
You know like one of the questions I've faced in Canada is well, why should we care about what's happening

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:29.679
Yeah-- In the ivory tower? If you're gonna hire these people next year. You are well. Yeah well

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:34.240
They're it's the heart like what's happening in the campuses is going to happen in society in five years

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.939
It's already that goes it's already happens. This is actually important point

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:43.240
I just gave a talk at a big law firm here in New York where they're very devoted to diversity, but they're doing it

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.949
Right they're really thinking about diverse like why is diversity good, and spent a whole month on viewpoint diversity

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:49.610
which is just fantastic and

01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:53.169
What I'm learning from talking to a number of people in the business world is

01:02:53.390 --> 01:03:01.029
That in the last year there are now all these pressures on leaders to endorse this condemn that sign this open letter

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:08.169
That's right, that's right, but it's the same dynamic. We have on campus and the answer to it

01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:12.130
So if anybody anybody watching here if you run a business if you have friends who are in business

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:16.000
I think the only the there are only two stable equilibria

01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:20.439
One is that every organization is just either all right wing we're all left-wing

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.340
But that would be disastrous you so either you just say okay, we're on one side, but that would be terrible

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:28.240
The other is what we call the Chicago principles of free expression

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:34.690
The University of Chicago has the best statement out there on how the University provides a platform on which

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:38.949
Multiple views can contest the university does not take any one side

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:45.610
That's the only other stable alternative, and I think leaders need to do this in business, certainly in universities

01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:52.029
So we're encouraging every University to adopt the Chicago principles because a lot of what mass action is is an attempt to

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:56.890
Compel the authority to come in on your side and punish your enemies. Yeah

01:03:56.890 --> 01:04:02.589
And so that has to stop-- So so how how effectively is the Chicago statement on on

01:04:03.290 --> 01:04:09.189
How effectively is the Chicago statement being disseminated how rapidly are universities signing up or or?

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.970
They're, a few signed on early in this whole crisis

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:18.129
Perdue, they're about 10 or 15 that have that have endorsed it or something like it

01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:23.439
It's not enough to just endorse something but if you have leadership that's committed to

01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:26.949
Creating an open platform in which people can disagree

01:04:27.529 --> 01:04:33.639
And and one thing that's very encouraging. I've been invited by a number of university presidents to come speak

01:04:34.249 --> 01:04:37.089
We have all kinds of innovations at Heterodox Academy

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.989
To foster a more inclusive climate in which people can actually

01:04:42.229 --> 01:04:43.579
engage with difference

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:51.308
There's a lot of interest so I think the university leaders were very slow to react they didn't want to alienate certain factions of students

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.989
But they're almost all reasonable people they're almost all liberal left

01:04:56.690 --> 01:05:01.419
Not illiberal, they're horrified by what's going on. They know they're sitting atop a powder keg

01:05:01.479 --> 01:05:07.119
They don't want things to blow up in their face as happened at Evergreen so this brings us to our

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:11.769
Another product the one that we're most excited by so it just went online

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:20.000
Actually today, it's called the OpenMind Platform. If you go to openmindplatform.org

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:28.220
You can find we've developed an app we have a whole library of readings and videos, we developed an app that guides you through

01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:34.599
We don't just say here's how to engage with different viewpoints we start by saying why is it good?

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:38.950
And we make the case that you need this everybody needs this and two

01:05:40.249 --> 01:05:42.939
We remind people that we're all basically

01:05:43.249 --> 01:05:49.689
Self-righteous hypocrite so we have quotes from wisdom traditions around the world and we've all heard this so just a little bit of you know

01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:51.690
you can call it emotional manipulation if you like but just

01:05:52.579 --> 01:05:58.899
Get people into a mindset in which they're willing to say oh yeah, whoa you know calm down. We're all we're all

01:05:59.779 --> 01:06:00.880
too self-righteous here

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.219
And then we then we teach them some psychology

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:08.468
About motivated reasoning and only then do we teach them to engage with views that are not their own

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.159
So we've already run this in about 15 or 20 classes

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:17.409
The results so far look promising. In that, at the end of it the measures show that students are more open to other ideas

01:06:17.989 --> 01:06:21.218
So the OpenMind Platform, we think is a tool that

01:06:21.859 --> 01:06:25.689
We think a lot of universities are going to adopt. There's a lot of interest in it and

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:34.089
If there's leadership if the professors generally do support viewpoint diversity and open inquiry if we change freshman orientation

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:37.869
so that students are trained first and foremost in how to

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:42.819
Step back, give people that benefit of the doubt the open-minded if we do that first

01:06:43.339 --> 01:06:45.339
You know that's like behavioral

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:49.389
exposure to some degree right the idea would be that if you're if you're

01:06:49.819 --> 01:06:53.139
Afraid or disgusted by something that you don't understand

01:06:53.390 --> 01:07:00.549
the appropriate first treatment first of all the treatment is necessary because otherwise you'll you'll isolate yourself in the ways that you already described and

01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:02.829
Second that brief exposure

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:05.530
Voluntary exposure is going to be the best curative

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:08.409
That's the opposite of the safe space idea

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:12.399
Exactly need to be the safe space the same space idea is the worst thing you could possibly

01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:14.709
Do for the very people yeah exactly exactly

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:16.780
I mean the psychology what you know

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:23.559
The psychology behind safe spaces and microaggressions is just the exact opposite of what we should be doing if we want to create kids

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:28.419
Especially black kids, gay kids, women, whatever if you think that they are

01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:36.010
Vulnerable to more stigma more conflict if you think that they are vulnerable. That's especially when a safe space will be

01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:37.730
temporarily

01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:43.599
Pleasant but in the long run bad. Right and that's the critical issue too with regards to safe spaces is that they're

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:47.530
Sacrificing the medium and long term of the students' well-being

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:51.940
Let's say to the short term lack of fear and conflict

01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:56.980
They're infantilizing them essentially so yeah, okay, so all right

01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:00.640
So I was thinking about the the discussion idea

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:05.379
I've got a personality test online now that's based on this Big Five aspect scale

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:11.020
but it might be interesting as something for us to think about to to find people who are high in openness and low in

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:18.609
Conscientiousness or orderliness and offer them the opportunity to engage in dialogue with people who have the opposite personality traits

01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:26.289
you know because well first of all because they're gonna run into people like that always right and and and maybe even establish a

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.069
relationship with them

01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:35.319
inadvertently and so being able to tolerate that might give them the kind of insight that you said you developed when you realized that the

01:08:35.449 --> 01:08:40.089
conservative ethos was based on a reasonable, but not complete set of

01:08:40.699 --> 01:08:41.699
of

01:08:41.699 --> 01:08:46.129
Beneficial axiomatic presuppositions so alright so now

01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:51.139
This is pretty much taken over your life this Heterodox Academy as well as the writing now

01:08:51.139 --> 01:08:54.348
you're writing a couple of new books I understand yeah, so

01:08:55.079 --> 01:08:58.639
so since so I was in the psychology department at the University of Virginia for

01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:03.348
For 17 years and when my book The Righteous Mind was coming out

01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:07.819
I wanted to move to New York City for a year, so I could you know do promotional work for it

01:09:07.819 --> 01:09:10.008
And I just had my second child was just born

01:09:10.009 --> 01:09:12.109
I knew it would be hard to fly from Charlottesville

01:09:12.299 --> 01:09:18.589
So I just happened to get a position a temporary position here at Stern at the business school and when I first arrived

01:09:18.589 --> 01:09:20.589
I wasn't that interested in business

01:09:21.089 --> 01:09:27.048
but as soon as I got here Occupy Wall Street happened and suddenly it was like everyone's talking about morality and politics and

01:09:27.179 --> 01:09:30.708
Capitalism and business, and then I started learning about the history of capitalism

01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:36.919
And I knew nothing about it was fascinating and I started seeing how free enterprise and free markets have helped

01:09:37.469 --> 01:09:40.638
Raise... raise living standards around the world. Yes

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:44.839
Radical decline in poverty-- In a staggeringly rapid fashion that's completely

01:09:45.389 --> 01:09:50.509
Unprecedented, especially since the year 2000. That's right so since so you know here

01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:52.130
I was 48 years old discovering

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:56.539
I had nothing about it was like when I first learned about evolution like wow this explains like

01:09:56.909 --> 01:10:04.489
Everything in the natural world and learning about capitalism business explained everything about the built world and the world that we actually live in

01:10:04.739 --> 01:10:06.059
and

01:10:06.059 --> 01:10:08.059
They were also all these business scandals

01:10:08.059 --> 01:10:14.748
This was 2011 in the wake of the financial crisis, and I saw a huge opening to begin applying moral psychology to help

01:10:15.479 --> 01:10:17.479
corporations have better ethics

01:10:17.969 --> 01:10:23.779
So I then everything I do is involves applying moral psychology to help complex systems work better

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:29.239
So I've been focused on political polarization and governance for years before then and that led to The Righteous Mind

01:10:29.239 --> 01:10:34.248
And then I got here to Stern they offered me a job during that first year, and I took it and it's been fantastic

01:10:34.289 --> 01:10:36.439
It's been really exciting. It's like a whole new

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:36.869
you

01:10:36.869 --> 01:10:41.328
know almost like being back in grad school a whole bunch of new things to learn. It must be a kind of a shock and

01:10:41.329 --> 01:10:46.458
Existential shark to be in a business school in some sense. It's not a shock. I mean it's a different culture

01:10:46.459 --> 01:10:50.779
It's much more open in the sense that it's so diverse like the things people are doing

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:52.939
There's not like a way that we do things here

01:10:52.939 --> 01:10:57.629
And it's much more open to applied projects to actually yeah to applied projects yeah

01:10:57.630 --> 01:11:02.039
And so is a perfect time for me like I just you know The Righteous Mind thing that wraps up like the first half of

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:07.710
My career like everything I did is in that book and now it's time for something new and that new thing was going to be

01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:11.759
Looking at how morality or moral psychology both

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:20.250
underlines, or is the foundation for our ability to do capitalism like contracts reciprocity all sorts of things and how our

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:21.820
left-right divide

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:25.019
From The Righteous Mind makes it hard for us to figure out

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:30.780
What's true like if you raise the minimum wage does that help or hurt the working poor right if you're an economist on the left

01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:35.730
Obviously helps them they're economist on the right it obviously hurts them because fewer of them have jobs. And you can

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:41.190
Gerrymander the measurement devices to produce the conclusions that you want which is a big problem. That's right

01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:46.440
So I'm supposed to be writing a book called Three Stories About Capitalism: The Moral Psychology of Economic Life

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.440
And so I started traveling around the world looking at how

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.790
Development is going in various countries

01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:56.519
I did a three-month trip to Asia in 2015 I came back from Asia

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.800
My article came out with Lukianoff on The Coddling the American Mind, the BBS article was published

01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:05.760
And I thought ok now I can get back to this you know keep read this capitalism book

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.559
And then the university is kind of began melting down in the fall, and then we started Heterodox Academy

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.539
And so yes it has taken over my life. It's it's basically a full-time job in addition to trying to write

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:18.210
the I'm also working on a book so

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.170
Lukianoff

01:12:19.170 --> 01:12:25.079
And I didn't want to turn our article into a book because we thought we'd said everything but man have things been happening fast

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:31.260
We've learned so much more since we wrote that article. And you wrote that article when? How long-- Well we wrote it in late 2014

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:35.610
And then we you know edited it in early 2015 and it finally came out in August of 2015

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.679
And so in last October Greg wrote to me and said John

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:44.309
I think I do want to turn the article into a book because we know so much more now

01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:46.290
And it's the problem is so much more serious

01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:53.610
Than it was then and the evidence, my God, the evidence about mental the mental health crisis of adolescents when Greg and I wrote the article

01:12:53.710 --> 01:12:58.710
We were you know we saw lots of hints that depression and anxiety were going way up-- Yeah--

01:12:58.710 --> 01:13:01.109
And we think that's related to the overprotection

01:13:01.450 --> 01:13:05.130
Yeah ok so let's talk about that just for a sec and then go back to the book

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:09.389
So I've got a potential demographic explanation for that in part well

01:13:09.389 --> 01:13:11.939
And I don't know if you guys have looked into this or not well

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:15.659
There's there's two things that I think might be contributing to it

01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:22.949
One is two or three things one is the average age at which children are

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:26.909
The average age at which people have children has gone way up

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:33.690
Why does that matter? Well because I think people get more conservative and cautious as they get older. A little bit, true

01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:36.329
But it's a very small effect okay, and it's wait a second, okay

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:42.089
It's the having of the kids, which is what makes them more conservative when you have kids you are more threat sensitive

01:13:42.090 --> 01:13:44.460
You're more likely to vote for the right-wing party so

01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.980
Just delaying child child

01:13:47.409 --> 01:13:50.459
Birth wouldn't okay. What about what about fewer siblings?

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:55.949
That would yes that's part of it, and this is what we're seeing in Asia too when you have a lot of kids

01:13:56.739 --> 01:13:59.999
You're not quite as worried. You don't have all your eggs in one basket. Well

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.459
And you can't be quite as worried and the siblings raise each other-- that's right-- right and then there's a lot of dominance hierarchies

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.420
struggle. That's right, exactly-- They play and fight

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:12.810
It's the free play and the fighting the working things out for themselves those are essential skills of adulthood

01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:14.610
Okay, so good, so then all right

01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:19.889
Yeah, let me only size is part of it right well, and then also what's happening increasingly in schools

01:14:19.889 --> 01:14:23.578
Is that kids aren't allowed free play, and they're certainly not allowed

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:30.269
Rough-and-tumble free play. Exactly that's right. That's one of the biggest things as well so the two that there are three giant

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.650
There are a lot of problems

01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:38.009
I mean this is such actually it's really a fun puzzle because it's like the biggest social science puzzle of our age. What is happening

01:14:38.010 --> 01:14:42.989
That's making so many of our systems go haywire, and I'm focusing on the university the big three

01:14:42.989 --> 01:14:49.529
I would say our one is the loss of free of unsupervised free play. Yeah, okay, and Peter Gray has been brilliant on this

01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:54.690
He's at Boston College showing how even among young animals they have to practice the skills for adulthood

01:14:54.690 --> 01:15:02.759
Yeah
And getting in conflicts and then dealing with it and sometimes losing and will come back

01:15:03.429 --> 01:15:06.989
Having a game in which there's a problem, but you have to work it out or the game stops

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.969
That's what kids always did. Yeah.

01:15:08.969 --> 01:15:14.110
It's only recently the 90s in the 90s that they're always supervised because we're afraid if we take our eyes off them

01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:14.610
The moderate left puts its best foot forward, arguing traditional liberal values of the university, explaining how extreme leftism on campus is a deep threat to the identity of the University at virtually all levels.

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:17.579
They'll be kidnapped, and it was never a risk was never you know

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:22.909
I've kind of wondered about this gender flexibility issue as form of delayed fantasy play

01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:29.030
You're getting Freudian on me, go ahead. Well because because it looks to me like that is you know when kids are little and three

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:35.090
And four say three to seven they do a tremendous amount of identity play you know they pretend they're animals they pretend

01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:37.090
They're their parents they

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:40.080
They pretend they're girls if they're boys they pretend they're boys

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:45.480
If they're girls like they really do a tremendous amount of identity play and one of the things that's been really

01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:47.809
Puzzling me is well. What happens if that isn't

01:15:49.050 --> 01:15:54.860
If they never have an opportunity for that because they're not engaging in fantasy play, maybe it's just delayed till adulthood

01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:01.099
So because played it's almost impossible to overstate the importance of that rough-and-tumble play

01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:05.059
And then the fantasy play that enables you to adopt different identities

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:12.230
And then the negotiated games that you talked about that enabled people to handle both both victory, but even more importantly loss

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:18.590
That's possible that could well be I that I have no opinion on you know, but the big three factors that I think are

01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:25.130
Explaining to explain what's happening on campus are one the loss of the unsupervised play so that the kids

01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:30.590
have always there's always an adult present and so they come to college and they expect there to be an adult and Dean somebody if

01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:32.370
There's a conflict that's one

01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:38.990
Two is social media, which hit just as iGen, so iGen, internet generation. This is Jene Twenge's work

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:41.180
You know we used to we used to think that

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:46.130
We used to think that the millennial generation ends in

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:53.690
1998 or 2000 but Jene Twenge shows looking at four large datasets that birth year 1995

01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:58.460
Kids born in 1995 and after are really different, their values are different

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:05.089
They have much higher rates of anxiety and depression especially the girls boys have gone up, girls have gone way up

01:17:06.090 --> 01:17:10.190
And the reason seems to be that Facebook lowered its age

01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:17.570
So in 2005 you had to be a college student at a certain number of colleges to get Facebook

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:24.170
In 2006 you could be any eleven-year-old who lies and says that she's 13 and you've got a Facebook account

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:31.160
But then you're using it on your parents, PC and in 2007 the iPhone comes out

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:34.099
And it saturates the market faster than any consumer product ever has

01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:36.530
so by 2010 or 11

01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:41.599
A lot of adolescents have have Facebook and other social platforms

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:47.930
And this is just devastating especially to girls because it's not texting texting is just me to you

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:51.769
You know that's back and forth that's fine that you know we, when we were kids we called our friends on the phone

01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:55.280
That's fine the problem seems to be according to Twenge. It's especially

01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.680
Platforms in which he put something out, and then you wait and see what everyone says it right and that

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:06.160
Especially is damaging to girls who already are at risk of eating disorders and image issues. Okay, okay

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:12.380
So so girls become more susceptible to negative emotion when they hit puberty. Well, well they're-- Yes-- Yes, ok

01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:16.160
then there's another issue too with regards to female aggression so

01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:21.260
You know it's clearly the case that males are more likely to be physically

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:27.229
Damaging slash aggressive than females are but what females use is reputation savaging

01:18:27.330 --> 01:18:30.499
That's Nicki Crick's work, Nikki Crick passed away a couple years ago

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:33.709
Showed that if you add it all up boys and girls are equally aggressive

01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:40.669
But the boys aggression is more physical the girls the more relational so if you imagine a bunch of 13, 14 year-olds in

01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:44.479
their middle schools, and then you parachute in a whole bunch of iPhones

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.149
Everybody's got one in their pocket now. What are the boys gonna? Do they're gonna play video games that doesn't hurt anybody. Yeah

01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:56.390
But the girls are going to use it to amplify the social interactions, so this is Twenge's explanation

01:18:56.390 --> 01:19:01.459
I think it makes a lot of sense, so it's a it's a catastrophe. It's a crisis, and we're really hurting especially the girls

01:19:02.130 --> 01:19:04.310
So we've got to change something about that anyway

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:11.539
But social media is is possibly the largest single reason why things are going haywire on campus the third big factor

01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:14.959
and do you think it's primarily Facebook or can you tell well, it's it's a

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:19.370
The kids use a lot of different platforms, but from what I hear Instagram

01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:22.100
Facebook, SnapChat

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.910
Again the thing is it's one too many

01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:30.320
That's what's bad is anything if it's if it's you put something out there, and you see how many people liked it, right

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:35.449
That's what's right, and there's always the threat that it'll go viral in a terrible way so that's a hammer exactly

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.669
Or the Sword of Damocles

01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:42.680
That's like unlimited damage. Unlimited downside to saying something. So what do you do, so they're very careful. Right.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:47.329
So I don't know if I want to like that post because you know I could get in big trouble for it. Right

01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:49.999
Well the benefit to liking it is minimal and the potential catastrophe

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:54.649
Unless you're expected to like it in which case you better like it because you if you don't like it

01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:56.660
You'll get in trouble, so it's a much more of a mob

01:19:57.210 --> 01:20:01.250
Mentality kids are afraid. You know I'm not blaming the kids. I'm very sympathetic to me. These are my kids

01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:04.729
You know my kids are 11, and 7. They're gonna come up into this

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:08.090
So the kids have been raised in a in a social environment

01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:13.639
That's much more about mob mob formation and mob attacks and mob defend defenses against mobs

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:20.180
And then the so the third factor, then is the political polarization and the purification of institutions

01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:24.950
So if you imagine coming up in the 90s when political polarization is going up

01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:29.780
We're beginning to hate each other more across party lines, but it's not that hard not that that nasty

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:36.379
But it's been getting much much more hostile so that now if someone like if someone is if someone goes to a campus

01:20:36.450 --> 01:20:42.769
Republicans meeting if it's a democrat who goes to a meeting of the campus republicans has happened at UC Santa Cruz a couple weeks ago

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.450
and someone finds out you know that so the the

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:51.890
hatred the cross party hatred is so much stronger now and

01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:58.429
Many of our institutions are much purer, so if you went to college the 90s there might have been a few conservative professors around

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:02.870
But now there aren't so as you said before it's like exposure therapy if you've never

01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:08.659
Encountered a conservative idea and then a conservative like Heather McDonald comes to speak on your campus well

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:14.359
This is like a major immune response problem. We got to get the tribe together and mob her and you know shut her down

01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:22.879
So those are the I mean they're many other reasons, but the loss of unsupervised play social media and rise of polarization

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:27.650
Those are the three big ones. Right, well, those are big problems especially the loss of unsupervised play

01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:33.200
It's not it's not obvious at all how that might be addressed. Yes, it is! Okay, Good good. I everyone should buy

01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:37.249
Everyone should just buy Lenore Skenazy's book Free-Range Kids

01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:44.300
And then they should loosen up and give their kids more unsupervised time now. You can't do this alone. You'll be arrested

01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:45.110
Yeah

01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:50.060
I tried to get my son to go out across the street to you know buy groceries when he was you know nine years

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:54.800
Old yeah, and he'd say like, but you know daddy people look at me funny. There are no other kids out there

01:21:55.820 --> 01:22:04.180
And so Lenore has started a fantastic organization called Let Grow so if viewers go to letgrow.org

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:06.560
Okay, we'll put all this in the description all of these things

01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:12.679
So I'm on the board of it as an adviser Peter Gray an expert on play is on the board and they're doing these

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.010
simple things

01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:20.809
Simple simple things like you convince a school to just open up the playground an hour early

01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:23.419
Or keep it open after school

01:22:23.850 --> 01:22:27.260
Why should kids always have organized activities and soccer practice?

01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:31.160
Just give them a place to play where there's a nurse available if someone gets hurt

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:37.040
There is an adult, but he's not supervising. He's just over there right so don't worry parents

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:43.100
There is an adult, but beyond that is what they want and they just started this a few weeks ago, and the results are fantastic

01:22:43.650 --> 01:22:49.340
The kids are having so much fun. They are becoming more independent. They're more willing to do projects on their own

01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:54.050
It's working out great. So oh, that's really can't do this on your own, but the thing is

01:22:55.890 --> 01:23:02.809
So those are very practical that's very practical piece of advice for schools. It's like open up the unsupervised play

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:09.830
Facilities and and and facilitate their use. That's right. Give give everyone a place which is safe and by safe

01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:16.970
I mean physically safe right never use the word safety to describe emotions and ideas safety means physical safety

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:23.060
So you've got to provide a physically safe place for the kids to play and beyond that you let him go now there will arise

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:27.410
Problems of bullying so if it's repeated harassment, oh, you know well

01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:30.229
I know a book about that which it's by Dan Olweus

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:33.889
Called Bullying: What We Know and What We Can Do About It, and it was written

01:23:33.930 --> 01:23:37.369
it's got to be 30 years ago and Olweus cut the...

01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:39.979
the the the

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:46.370
Incidence of bullying in the Scandinavian countries down by 50% and he really really targets

01:23:46.370 --> 01:23:50.149
What bullying means, so he's not a safe space guy by any stretch of the imagination

01:23:50.670 --> 01:23:53.180
I don't know what the origins of it are

01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:58.070
I know that evaluations of his program in America show anywhere from zero to 20 percent reductions

01:23:58.070 --> 01:24:01.429
Yeah, well like so this are much smaller-- in the U.S?-- In the U.S.

01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:06.379
Yeah, the question is whether or not they were able to implement them with the rigor he did, in the U.S.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:11.059
Yeah, but bullying programs are part of the problem because bullying clearly is a problem

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:14.460
We need to do something about it, but because we have what's called concept creep

01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:19.660
Yes, oh so, it's now my joint concept creep looks like even yeah, that's right

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:26.819
So now it's the case that if if kids don't invite if some kids want to do something

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:31.440
And they don't invite another kid they've excluded that kid right. Well. That could be bullying right?

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:36.320
I've read of schools in Europe that don't allow kids to have best friends for exactly that reason

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:36.880
Yeah

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:41.640
Well because the this is also something that really bothers me about the misuse of the IAT [Implicit Association Test]

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:45.140
Because it's not that easy to distinguish in group preference

01:24:45.150 --> 01:24:50.609
Which no one can know one when their right mind would want to eliminate in group preference given that it

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:54.929
Governs your choice of mate and your behavior towards your family members

01:24:54.930 --> 01:24:55.870
Let's say

01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:57.990
to distinguish that between out group

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:03.630
Exclusion is no in no simple matter and to tell kids that they can't have a best friend is another thing that

01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:06.000
interferes with an important part of their-- That's right

01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:11.279
Yeah, I think both of us have spent a lot of time looking at ancient wisdom at the writings of

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:19.170
People long ago, and I often come back to Aristotle's claim that any virtue carried to extremes becomes a vice

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:25.590
so inclusion is a good thing if people are being excluded because they have a physical stigma or

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:32.039
Because or they're overweight or their skin color, so you know we need to be looking at the reasons

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:36.300
Why kids are excluded, but if you say inclusion is the primary virtue

01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:44.489
Inclusion over everything else and so if those two best friends are excluding others. No more best friend. All right. This is madness

01:25:44.490 --> 01:25:51.570
Yeah, this is a vice so I think that inclusion again. You know it's a virtue unless it's carried to extremes

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:55.679
Well, that's probably a pretty good place to stop

01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:00.930
I would say unless you have do you have anything else that you wanted to talk about we were we talked about the role of

01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:06.480
Religion mm-hm and in the fact that people are naturally religious thinkers. Yeah, we talked about the Heterodox Academy

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:12.959
We talked about your work on disgust and your plans for the Academy you talked about your books. Is there anything else that

01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:16.920
That might be of interest that you can think of just

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:20.849
That I'll just say that I'm actually

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:27.570
Optimistic about what's going to happen on campus. I think things might continue to get worse this year

01:26:29.170 --> 01:26:34.830
But I think there's an interesting phenomenon called preference falsification when you have

01:26:35.530 --> 01:26:37.649
People not speaking honestly

01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:41.040
They as you had under communism

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:47.760
When you have a whole system or almost everybody thinks this is terrible. I hate this, but I don't dare say anything

01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:51.120
When you have preference falsification, work by Timur Kuran

01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:56.219
And everybody hears everybody else's preferences, so they think okay, that's what everybody thinks

01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:03.120
When you have an unraveling it can unravel very quickly and that's what happened in the communist countries because everybody hated it

01:27:03.490 --> 01:27:09.929
And it fell amazingly quickly, and I think the you know the the push back at Reed last week

01:27:09.930 --> 01:27:17.099
Or there was really last week, so I think because most people we're starting to see is that a lot of people of color also

01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:22.470
Is they you know you're not speaking for me. I mean every group is diverse and so

01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:29.099
when you have a variety of people and you have progressives speaking you have a variety of people I

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:34.350
Think we're going to see more and more people standing up saying wait, what's happening is this is not right

01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:37.410
This is illiberal. This is opposed to the values of the academy

01:27:37.410 --> 01:27:40.079
This is not what I want for myself or my kids or my students

01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:44.309
So I do think that we're gonna start seeing a lot more people standing up

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:50.339
And one of our goals at Heterodox Academy is to just help put out the ideas that people need and this is what you're doing

01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:53.250
to just put out the ideas critique the bad ideas and

01:27:54.010 --> 01:27:55.450
put out

01:27:55.450 --> 01:27:59.849
concepts in that that can contest in this space of ideas

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:05.699
Get good information, so if people go to heterodoxacademy.org on our research pages

01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:10.439
We have all the information that what about the polls say? What's the current information about about students' attitudes?

01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:15.780
We have the history of this we have a lot of research on who is more biased left or right well turns out both sides

01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:17.440
Are about equally biased

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:21.419
so we think that by just doing what we actually do well as

01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:27.030
Academics, that is research, making arguments, being calm and civil

01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:32.220
We actually think that we can turn this around so if anybody watching this is a professor I would

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:35.400
Invite you to join go to heterodoxacademy.org

01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:38.100
Okay, so let me ask you one more question

01:28:38.710 --> 01:28:45.460
I mean I'm that that sounds good, and I'm it's good to hear that you're optimistic. I mean I waver

01:28:47.150 --> 01:28:48.530
Although I wouldn't say I'm pessimistic

01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:54.610
I just think we're in one of those situations where things could spiral in either direction very rapidly and that worries me

01:28:55.130 --> 01:29:01.239
What about the disciplines on campus that seem to be primarily devoted to the activist cause?

01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:08.620
Like because my view is or my fear is that we've subsidized the activist disciplines

01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:14.199
Let's say women's studies as a good example, but we could say social work, and then the faculties of Education now as well

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:16.200
I think they're in the same in the same

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.640
Bin let's let's let's put it that way

01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:23.830
the Women's Studies programs in particular their their express goal

01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:26.380
Expressed on their websites is to produce

01:29:26.690 --> 01:29:28.690
social justice radical left-leaning

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:35.169
activists and so like for a while one of the things I proposed in Canada was that the

01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:42.190
Conservatives in particular cut the university funding by 25 percent so that the universities would have to sort themselves out

01:29:42.190 --> 01:29:46.899
But then that was that was a provocative claim obviously, but then I thought well

01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:52.389
That's not a good idea because it opens up the door to political interference in the Academy and that's bad. That's

01:29:53.510 --> 01:30:00.790
That's right, but the Academy has done a very bad job of policing itself methodologically, and we have these disciplines Women's Studies

01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:06.370
I think is a prime example and that's been very much criticized in Canada by Janice Fiamengo who used to be yeah

01:30:06.370 --> 01:30:11.559
Yeah, she is and she's she's not in her natural milieu when she's doing such things

01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:19.360
you know she's a brave and tough person and she's gone after the Women's Studies types on methodological grounds particularly, but

01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:26.259
But there are people who are working full-time at doing nothing, but producing the kind of pol...

01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:30.010
So what do you have any thoughts about? Yes, I do I think so

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.239
Here I teach in the business school here, and I teach a course called Professional Responsibility

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:41.530
And I teach my students about their fiduciary duties their duties to their employers the duties that we have to each other

01:30:42.650 --> 01:30:47.350
And fiduciary duty refers to a very very high standard of care if you're managing someone's money

01:30:47.630 --> 01:30:51.639
You know you you really have to be committed to doing what's in their interest not in your interest

01:30:52.190 --> 01:30:59.109
And I think we need that concept in the Academy we have I'm not sure if recall fiduciary duties or just professional duties

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:03.610
But I think we have two primary professional duties that we must never never betray

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:08.470
One the most important one in our role as scholars is our duty to the truth

01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:10.310
we must never

01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:16.240
Say things that we think are false or allow people to say things that we think are false because we're afraid

01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:20.230
if we challenge them we'll get in trouble so we have a fiduciary due to the truth and

01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:27.100
political ideological commitments clearly warp us they make us do things they make they push us so

01:31:28.730 --> 01:31:34.270
We've got a whole we've got to recognize that if we let our systems get out of whack we are betraying the truth

01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:38.229
We're systemically what you want to we have what a systemic truth-ism problem

01:31:38.230 --> 01:31:40.959
We are systemically betraying the truth in many of our disciplines

01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:44.320
So I think we need an awareness of that and we need to hold herself to a higher standard

01:31:44.690 --> 01:31:49.299
Then in our role as teachers we have and here we really can call it a fiduciary duty

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:56.470
These are people's children who are sent to us to educate to enlarge their minds to teach them skills

01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:02.590
If we were to use them for our sexual pleasure it's obviously a horrific crime

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:08.289
But what is it if we use them for our ideological purposes if we say you've given your children to educate

01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:15.549
I'm waging a political battle. I'm gonna try to get use this as tools tools. That is horrific that is unacceptable

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:18.220
We are violating our duties so I think

01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:24.190
Right, but the the response to that especially from the postmodernist types is that

01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:26.740
That's all there. Is there's only

01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:28.490
ideological aspect

01:32:28.490 --> 01:32:36.130
so back to your original question are there problem departments absolutely so I wanted to put forth these two commitments to truth and

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.770
to educating not indoctrinating yeah, and

01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:44.559
Universities that embrace these highest goals like the University of Chicago. I think is the best candidate

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:48.940
will probably find that they need to

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:52.480
Do something about departments they don't live up to those goals

01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:57.489
Other universities, and I think Brown is leading the way on this one so far

01:32:57.490 --> 01:32:58.400
I mean the

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:05.839
Early 2015 the president had all kinds of statements about Brown is committed to social justice a fundamental bedrock commitment to social justice she said

01:33:06.150 --> 01:33:09.920
so if some universities choose to devote themselves to social justice

01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:17.270
That's fine. Just be upfront about it say so so students will know if you want social justice training you go to Brown

01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:21.769
but if you want to actually be trained to find the truth to do research you go to Chicago and

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.969
I think we're gonna see people

01:33:23.969 --> 01:33:28.069
Flooding to Chicago and schools like it so what I'm hoping

01:33:28.230 --> 01:33:33.560
What I'm hoping so that's the mechanism there if they if they make it if they make their statements public

01:33:33.719 --> 01:33:35.809
That the choice of the students will be

01:33:35.909 --> 01:33:42.049
To go to the universities that hold the principles that you just described over the other one so it'll be a marketplace choice exactly

01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:44.300
That's right, so that's why I said when I talk about the Emperor's New Clothes

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.570
We have a situation

01:33:45.570 --> 01:33:53.179
We have a gigantic market failure in which our top universities are offering the product that most consumers don't want

01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:54.870
and

01:33:54.870 --> 01:34:00.979
So my prediction is that Chicago is going to see a huge surge of applications this year, and if that's true

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:03.440
I think other universities are going

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:08.390
They're gonna take notice so I'm hoping that we'll see a schism in the American Academy

01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:14.659
Between those universities that stand up and say this is madness. We are committed to providing a platform

01:34:14.659 --> 01:34:16.819
We don't discriminate based on viewpoint politics

01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:21.169
That's the Chicago Way, and those that say no we're about social justice come here

01:34:21.170 --> 01:34:24.080
And we will train you to fight for social justice and against the right

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:30.290
So if people have clear choices, then I think we're gonna see a big change

01:34:30.330 --> 01:34:32.779
And that's why I'm optimistic cuz I think we're gonna see that

01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:37.429
All right, well. Thank you very much. It was great talking with you
