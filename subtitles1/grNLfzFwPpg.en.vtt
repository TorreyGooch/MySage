meaning and that's Primary in the system
 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.830 align:start position:0%
meaning and that's Primary in the system
it's<00:01:39.079><c> not</c><00:01:39.640><c> a</c><00:01:39.799><c> set</c><00:01:39.960><c> of</c><00:01:40.200><c> ideas</c><00:01:40.920><c> like</c><00:01:41.119><c> Marxism</c>

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's not a set of ideas like Marxism
 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.149 align:start position:0%
it's not a set of ideas like Marxism
it's<00:01:42.079><c> actually</c><00:01:42.600><c> a</c><00:01:42.680><c> set</c><00:01:42.840><c> of</c><00:01:43.040><c> attach</c><00:01:43.600><c> emotional</c>

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's actually a set of attach emotional
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.149 align:start position:0%
it's actually a set of attach emotional

the more emotional side of it uh let's
 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.030 align:start position:0%
the more emotional side of it uh let's
call<00:02:15.640><c> it</c><00:02:16.080><c> the</c><00:02:16.519><c> compassionate</c><00:02:17.239><c> side</c><00:02:17.480><c> so</c><00:02:17.720><c> I</c><00:02:17.959><c> I</c>

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
call it the compassionate side so I I
 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.869 align:start position:0%
call it the compassionate side so I I
want<00:02:18.120><c> to</c><00:02:18.280><c> ask</c><00:02:18.480><c> you</c><00:02:18.959><c> and</c><00:02:19.200><c> and</c><00:02:19.280><c> you</c><00:02:19.440><c> talked</c><00:02:19.720><c> about</c>

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 align:start position:0%
want to ask you and and you talked about
 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.670 align:start position:0%
want to ask you and and you talked about
it<00:02:20.080><c> as</c><00:02:20.319><c> bottomup</c><00:02:20.879><c> and</c><00:02:21.040><c> emotion-driven</c>

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
it as bottomup and emotion-driven
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.190 align:start position:0%
