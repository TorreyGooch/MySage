outcome of subversion well okay so so
let's<00:01:52.000><c> let's</c><00:01:52.280><c> take</c><00:01:52.520><c> that</c><00:01:53.200><c> apart</c><00:01:54.360><c> further</c><00:01:55.360><c> so</c>

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
let's let's take that apart further so
 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.590 align:start position:0%
let's let's take that apart further so
you<00:01:56.600><c> talk</c><00:01:56.960><c> about</c><00:01:57.640><c> a</c><00:01:58.600><c> uh</c><00:01:59.200><c> relapse</c><00:02:00.000><c> into</c><00:02:00.280><c> a</c><00:02:00.439><c> kind</c>

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
you talk about a uh relapse into a kind
 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.870 align:start position:0%
you talk about a uh relapse into a kind
of<00:02:00.840><c> tribalism</c><00:02:01.520><c> of</c><00:02:01.759><c> idea</c><00:02:02.119><c> ownership</c><00:02:02.719><c> so</c>

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
of tribalism of idea ownership so
 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.870 align:start position:0%
of tribalism of idea ownership so
there's<00:02:03.079><c> a</c><00:02:03.399><c> disintegration</c><00:02:04.399><c> of</c><00:02:04.600><c> something</c>

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
there's a disintegration of something
 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.870 align:start position:0%
there's a disintegration of something
that<00:02:05.000><c> was</c><00:02:05.200><c> unified</c><00:02:05.759><c> into</c><00:02:06.000><c> a</c><00:02:06.159><c> more</c><00:02:06.960><c> pluralistic</c>

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
that was unified into a more pluralistic
 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.389 align:start position:0%
that was unified into a more pluralistic
tribal<00:02:08.560><c> landscape</c><00:02:09.560><c> okay</c><00:02:09.679><c> so</c><00:02:09.920><c> that's</c><00:02:10.119><c> one</c><00:02:10.280><c> of</c>

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
tribal landscape okay so that's one of
 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.229 align:start position:0%
tribal landscape okay so that's one of
the<00:02:10.560><c> things</c><00:02:10.879><c> let's</c><00:02:11.120><c> Identify</c><00:02:11.760><c> some</c><00:02:11.879><c> of</c><00:02:12.040><c> the</c>

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
the things let's Identify some of the
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.670 align:start position:0%
the things let's Identify some of the
other<00:02:13.239><c> characteristics</c><00:02:14.080><c> of</c><00:02:14.280><c> the</c><00:02:14.879><c> collapse</c><00:02:15.879><c> so</c>

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
other characteristics of the collapse so
 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.830 align:start position:0%
other characteristics of the collapse so
we<00:02:16.800><c> could</c><00:02:17.040><c> talk</c><00:02:17.280><c> about</c><00:02:17.879><c> purposeful</c><00:02:18.519><c> and</c>

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
we could talk about purposeful and
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.869 align:start position:0%
we could talk about purposeful and
accidental<00:02:19.440><c> subversion</c><00:02:20.120><c> so</c><00:02:20.360><c> let's</c><00:02:20.599><c> start</c>

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 align:start position:0%
accidental subversion so let's start
 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.949 align:start position:0%
accidental subversion so let's start
with<00:02:21.040><c> the</c><00:02:21.239><c> marxists</c><00:02:22.000><c> with</c><00:02:22.200><c> regard</c><00:02:22.519><c> to</c>

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
purposeful subversion okay so KL
 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.630 align:start position:0%
purposeful subversion okay so KL

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
about this because I think Marxism
 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.070 align:start position:0%
about this because I think Marxism
itself<00:06:14.080><c> is</c><00:06:14.199><c> a</c><00:06:14.479><c> variant</c><00:06:14.919><c> of</c><00:06:15.400><c> something</c><00:06:16.400><c> more</c>

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
itself is a variant of something more
 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.390 align:start position:0%
itself is a variant of something more
deeper<00:06:18.080><c> much</c><00:06:18.840><c> deeper</c>

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
deeper much deeper
 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.150 align:start position:0%

so<00:06:21.400><c> there's</c><00:06:21.639><c> a</c><00:06:22.199><c> there's</c><00:06:22.440><c> a</c><00:06:22.919><c> Marxist</c><00:06:23.720><c> like</c>

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's a Marxist like
 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.430 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's a Marxist like
spirit<00:06:24.800><c> that</c><00:06:25.319><c> inverts</c><00:06:25.919><c> the</c><00:06:26.039><c> French</c>
