00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.300
Now one of the things that people are very
much confused by in the modern world is what

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.649
archaic people meant by gods, and that’s
because whatever the deities were that had

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.360
the motive force that archaic people attributed
to the gods seemed to have disappeared in

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.330
modern culture. Now the Jungian in hypothesis
is that’s because they turned into psychological

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.140
traits, fundamentally, or motivational forces,
so what the, what archaic societies would

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.160
describe as gods, we would describe as motivational
forces,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.690
so, for example, Venus is a goddess, the goddess
of love, and we would associate her power

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.690
with love and sex fundamentally, and the reason
that that’s a reasonable association from

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.049
the archaic standpoint is because the motive
quality that makes up what Venus represents

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:46.049
is transpersonal, which means it’s not limited
to one person and it’s immortal in that

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.780
the motive force that characterizes sexual
affiliation exists whether or not a single

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.600
individual exists.
so it’s transpersonal, has the force of

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.909
a personality , because, if you fall in love,
you’re motivated by a certain set of standards

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.880
and perspectives, right, if you’re gripped
by beauty, say, or if you’re gripped by

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.870
lust, that imposes a particular view of the
world on you and impels your actions, sometimes

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.130
despite your will, and so that would be equivalent,
from the archaic perspective, to possession.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.260
And it’s clearly the case that archaic societies
who are engaged in warfare, for example, would

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.230
conduct rituals to ensure that the warriors
that made up their societies were, in fact,

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.620
possessed by the correct god, so it might
be Mars, for example, the Roman God of War,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.209
so that on the battlefield they exhibited
the proper characteristics of somebody who

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.380
was in a battle, right, rage you can think,
rage, so possession by the God of War would

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.970
be equivalent to this possession by a state
of rage

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.870
Now, it’s not quite that simple, it isn’t
only that archaic people externalized motive

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.760
forces and gave them the status of deities,
what they did was more complex than that,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.440
and I think you can understand that a little
bit better if you start to, if you start to

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.019
give some, uh, thought to the modern behavioral
notion of the stimulus.

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.620
Now the stimulus is a very, very weird concept,
because the behaviourists who were interested

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.320
in taking apart what was inside the brain
would attribute motive force to the stimulus,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.120
right, they’d say, if you present an animal
with a stimulus, he will therefor act, and

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.419
that meant that the behaviours were making
the presupposition that the motive power resided

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.320
in some manner in the stimulus. Well and why,
why would they think like that?

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.850
Well, it’s an archaic mode of thought in
a sense. You can imagine a child saying, um,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.940
one of my friends today made me really angry,
right, which means that the child is essentially

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.419
conflating his or her own internal emotional
state with the proximal stimulus that gave

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.570
rise to that state, and you see complex associations
like that taking place with regards to the

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.940
apprehension of beauty, say, because beauty
is a very, very complex and difficult to localize

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.280
phenomena; if you’re very attracted to someone,
are you attracted by them? Well in a sense,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.570
of course, you are, because there they are,
but in another sense you’re not at all because

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:08.000
what’s happening is that you’re engaged
as much in the in attraction as anything that’s

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.729
motivating you from the outside world, and
I think that partly accounts for your sense

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:16.130
of foolishness, especially if the person that
you’re attracted to doesn’t return your

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.410
attraction,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.410
I mean, you, you know that from your perceptual
perspective you’re attracted and dominated

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.030
by the object, but, uh, by the same token,
you know entirely that, easy as it is to presume

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.660
it’s them and their fault, say, pretty much
it all has to do with you, so in the modern

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.069
world where we’ve been able to separate
out the object and the motive force of the

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:44.009
object, the deities have sort of moved inside
of us and become psychological forces, but

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.659
you can understand if you think about it in
this manner that things weren’t so clear

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:52.409
prior to the dawn of the empirical age,

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:59.409
that gives you a little bit of background
with regards to what the notion of deity meant

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:07.689
to archaic societies who still utilize those
notions as explanatory terms. Okay, so we

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.729
know that if you’re caught up in one of
these little, uh, world games, that you may

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.729
be motivated by something very, very fundamental,
right, a, a tendency that transcends you the

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.979
tendency to propagate yourself, say, Freud’s
fundamental motivational level, sexual affiliation

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:31.330
or the tendency to maintain yourself, those
you could say are the fundamental gods of

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.900
existence, the fundamental driving forces,
and it’s there, it’s the interaction of

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.729
those two forces over great periods of time
that produce the great diversity of life and,

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.389
and human life, that we see before us, and
each of those fundamental, most fundamental

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:52.389
of gods, have their differentiated minion
so to speak so that while engaged in the meta

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:59.430
goal of self preservation, you act out plots
of hunger and plots of thirst and you move

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:06.229
from cold to hot or from hot to cold depending
on your particular, uh, on your particular,

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.400
on the particular temperature of your surroundings
or with regards to self propagation.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.289
You’re attracted to people or are repelled
by them for reasons that are frequently absolutely

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.169
beyond your comprehension by the way, so I
just found out this week, uh, and this is

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.419
absolutely staggering, I think, that if you,
um, if you run an experiment on a group of

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:29.219
women and you track their menstrual cycle,
and then you give them t-shirts that men have

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:35.020
worn to smell, that women who are ovulating
like the smell of symmetrical men better than

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.479
A-symmetrical men, so and that’s partly
because symmetrical men are probably more

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:45.439
healthy, but this is a good example of how
the motive forces that configure your world

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:50.030
are dependent on instinctual forces that are
not only beyond your consciousness, but they’re

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.610
beyond even, at the moment, any of our, uh,
explicit explanations.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:02.610
So, uh, another finding that’s very similar
that I came across recently, it turns out

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.999
that mice will not mate with mice that have
RH blood factors that are likely to produce,

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:17.999
um, unfit offspring, uh, the more closely
genetically related the RH factors, the more

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.719
likely there is to be a, a, an, a catastrophe
with regards to offspring, and the mice seem

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:28.900
to detect the RH factor by smell so recently
this was run by, with women, and it is also

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.289
the case that women prefer men whose RH factors
are at an optimal distance from them in terms

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:38.110
of smell, so this is some example of how these
unbelievably archaic systems, ‘cause like

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:44.979
the old factory systems are unbelievably archaic,
produce alterations in world view at a level

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:51.979
that’s massively below consciousness, so
underneath your cortical shell, which is tonically

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.999
inhibiting all your emotional and motivational
systems, lies all these motivational and emotional

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:04.229
systems, and they have branches that grow
up into the cortex, and they have the capacity

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:10.029
to control your behaviour completely and voluntarily,
so, for example, if you’re gripped by fear,

00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:13.860
if you’re gripped by fear, it’s very,
very difficult to overcome that voluntarily,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.379
and at least initially you won’t be able
to, which is to say that when the chips are

00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:24.279
down, the underlying motivational and emotional
systems have control. Okay. So then what happens

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:28.039
from that perspective, then what happens when
you encounter something you don’t understand,

00:08:28.039 --> 00:08:32.810
and I think the best way to explain it is
something like generalize disinhibition, which

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:38.229
is that all your underlying motivational and
emotional systems are more or less disinhibited

00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:42.430
simultaneously, and the reason for that is
because you want to be maximally prepared

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:46.610
to do whatever the hell is necessary to do
when you are somewhere that you don’t understand,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.540
and because you don’t know what that thing
is going to be, all your systems go on, and

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.130
when psychologists talk about stress, which
is an abysmal word, right, it means everything

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.510
and nothing, when psychologists talk about
stress, what they mean is, generalized disinhibition

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.740
of emotion and motivation

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:09.740
so then you come to the case of ancient Egypt
And one of the things Eliade points out, which

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.310
I think is really interesting, I mean really
phenomenal, the story I’m going to tell

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:21.529
you right now was essentially revealed in
Egyptian culture at the dawn of the culture

00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:26.380
rather than developing over the course of
the culture. So the Egyptians had a revelation,

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:32.260
right, immediately that the most fundamental
of gods was the one who created as a consequence

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:39.260
of his tongue and his speech, very much akin
to the Sumerian idea with regards to Marduk

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.459
and also to later Judao-Christian ideas.

00:09:43.459 --> 00:09:49.320
so here’s the story. There’s four players
in this drama, OK? There’s Osiris, his wife

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:56.320
Isis, Horace their son, and Seth. And Seth
is Osiris’ evil brother, OK? Now Osiris

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:05.740
was a remarkable guy. He was the founder of
the Egyptian state from the mythological perspective,

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.320
so kind of like Romulus and Remus for Rome,
a myth or like George Washington for the U.S.,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.660
right? A mythologized figure who represented
all of the Pharaohs and people for that matter

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.760
who’d actually constructed the Egyptian
state.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.720
Osiris, father of Egypt, so to speak, but
Osiris is kind of old and a little archaic

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.690
and maybe a little bit senile and even possibly
a little bit naïve in that you know even

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:33.730
no matter how great you were in your youth,
as time goes on you lose contact with environmental

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:38.649
transformations and the old rules that you
lived by are not necessarily applicable to

00:10:38.649 --> 00:10:43.339
the present and some of those things that
you ignore become paramount in importance.

00:10:43.339 --> 00:10:48.910
And it turns out that Osiris has an evil brother,
Seth, and Seth eventually turns into Satan

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:55.649
as mythology develops through the centuries.
And Seth is a nasty guy, right, I mean what

00:10:55.649 --> 00:11:02.190
he wants more than anything is undeserved
dominion over the Egyptian state. Now Osiris,

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:06.709
because he’s not paying attention and because
he isn’t sufficiently cognizant anymore

00:11:06.709 --> 00:11:13.709
of the power of evil, more or less ignores
his evil brother, who in turn chops him into

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:22.240
pieces and then distributes his pieces all
over the Egyptian state. Now you might say:

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.699
why didn’t he just kill him, right? I mean
you’d think chopping him up would kill him

00:11:26.699 --> 00:11:31.630
but he’s a god, you can’t just kill them.
The reason in mythology, and you see this

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:35.759
in movies as well, where the villain never
quite dies or the hero never quite dies, is

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:41.339
because even if you eliminate individual embodiments
of what those figures represent, new embodiments

00:11:41.339 --> 00:11:45.160
manifest themselves virtually immediately.
So one of the things mythology is quite clear

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.110
about is that you never win a final battle
with evil. It’s a permanent property of

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:56.360
the world.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:02.550
So anyways, Seth hacks up Osiris, spreads
him all over the land. Osiris ends up living

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:07.699
a kind of shadowy and nebulous ghost-like
existence down in the underworld and Seth

00:12:07.699 --> 00:12:14.699
becomes the ruler of the state. A nasty story.
Alright, but Osiris has Isis as a wife. Now

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:22.519
Isis had a huge cult. She was a powerful goddess,
goddess of the under world, a kind of combination

00:12:23.199 --> 00:12:28.680
of Kali and Diana, so to speak, capable of
tremendous destructive power but also the

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:35.139
source of all good things – something very
much like Tiamat. Now Isis got wind of her

00:12:35.139 --> 00:12:42.009
husband’s disintegration, so to speak, and
she went searching around Egypt till she found

00:12:42.009 --> 00:12:45.920
his phallus and with it she makes herself
pregnant.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:52.880
OK, so what does that mean exactly? It means
something like this. The collapse of any great

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:59.880
order brings with it new potential and I think
this is something that capitalism has way

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:07.800
over forms of government like communism. Capitalism
has mechanisms in place to allow large structures

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:14.130
that are no longer meeting their function
to collapse. But frequently when they collapse,

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:19.310
it’s not like they disintegrate into dust,
right, they disintegrate into sub-components,

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:25.360
so to speak, many of which then come to terms
with the fact that the order has collapsed

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.569
and build something new. So you can’t get
rid of culture so easily. You can hack it

00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:33.899
up into bits, you can disembody it, so to
speak, you can spread it all over the state,

00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:40.440
you can introduce chaos into it. But that’s
something that has the potential of new birth

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.850
like the phoenix rising from the ashes.
So anyways, Isis, who’s the matrix, who’s

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:52.850
Tiamat, gets Osiris’ phallus, which is the
container of the germ of culture, right, the

00:13:53.139 --> 00:13:59.149
phenomenon that’s capable of the seminal
idea, and she makes herself pregnant and she

00:13:59.149 --> 00:14:04.029
gives birth to Horace, who’s the long-lost
son of the rightful king, right, a very typical

00:14:04.029 --> 00:14:11.029
mythological motif. OK, so Horace is alienated
from the kingdom, which is another very common

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:16.550
mythological motif, you know like how King
Arthur, for example, is raised by commoners?

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:22.610
The same story pops up in the story for Christ,
for example, because Christ has heavenly parents

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:27.440
but then he also has kind of ordinary parents
and it’s a very common motif. Anyways, so

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:34.440
Horace grows up outside of the classical structure
of the Egyptian state, which is tilted terribly

00:14:36.139 --> 00:14:41.430
towards evil because Seth has dominated, because
Osiris was too blind to his evil brother to

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:46.129
take appropriate defensive actions, and he
grows to maturity. And then he decides, like

00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:52.100
all rightful sons of the long-lost king, to
reclaim his heritage. So he goes back to Egypt,

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:58.500
right, and he has this vicious battle with
Seth and in the process, Seth tears out one

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.379
of his eyes. Well, fine, and that’s an indication
of just exactly how devastating a battle with

00:15:04.379 --> 00:15:09.940
the forces of evil, so to speak, precisely
are. They represent a critical threat to the

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.370
integrity of consciousness, right? That’s
why he loses an eye. Well, luckily enough,

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.800
Horace has got his act together and he does
defeat Seth and he banishes him and he gets

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:25.800
the eye back. And then you think: OK, great,
pop the eye back in, become emperor, everything’s

00:15:26.379 --> 00:15:26.959
fine

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:30.860
Now let’s backtrack a little bit and think
about this politically. Now the Egyptians

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:37.319
had this really weird idea. They had the idea
that the living pharaoh was the living pharaoh

00:15:37.319 --> 00:15:42.000
and the dead pharaoh at the same time. makes
no sense rationally but it makes a lot of

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.730
sense from a narrative perspective because
what they were saying is something like this:

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:50.209
look, you got to think that when you become
king, or when you become president, or when

00:15:50.209 --> 00:15:55.620
you take on a role of that absolute magnitude,
that then you’re partly you but you’re

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.720
also partly this role and there’s really
no way out of that, right? And the role is

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:04.699
composed of the unbelievable weight of the
cultural tradition that you’re representing.

00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:08.540
And you can say: well, that’s true for being
king or for being president but it’s also

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:13.160
true if you become a doctor or a lawyer, any
sort of specialized occupation. It’s partly

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.790
you, because you’re embodying the role,
but it’s partly the role too. So the pharaoh

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:22.899
is the live pharaoh and the dead pharaoh because
the dead pharaoh represents culture, right?

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:25.779
The king is dead, long live the king.

00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:31.029
OK, but paralleling that idea was the idea
that the pharaoh was not only the dead pharaoh

00:16:31.029 --> 00:16:34.829
and the live pharaoh at the same time but
that he was Osiris and Horace at the same

00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:40.779
time. But then you think in the story, Horace
has taken over Seth, he’s got his eye back,

00:16:40.779 --> 00:16:45.040
he can be king. But he isn’t king yet and
this is where the Egyptians really get their

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:50.120
act together and I think, of the two stories
that I’m telling you, this is the one that

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.889
has the most significance, I think, for modern
people because we’re so likely to sidestep

00:16:54.889 --> 00:17:00.759
our obligation to our culture, whatever that
happens to be. So instead of popping this

00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:04.310
eye back in his head, which is the first thing
you’d think he does, he decides he’s going

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:09.060
to go back to the underworld, where Osiris
is living in this ghostlike and dead manner,

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.100
since he’s been chopped up by Seth. So he
goes down into the underworld, which is no

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:17.689
piece of cake, and he finds Osiris there in
this kind of half-dead state and he gives

00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:24.689
him his eye. And that enlightens Osiris, right,
it gives him vision and so then he takes Osiris

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:33.810
back to Egypt arm in arm, so to speak. And
it’s the conjunction of Osiris and Horace

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:38.950
that constitutes the basis for Egyptian sovereignty
and that is bloody brilliant, right, because

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:44.620
the Egyptians figured out that so Horace is
Marduk, for all intents and purposes, right?

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:50.810
He’s this avenging hero. In the Egyptian
story, he fights political corruption rather

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:55.420
than chaos but you can understand that those
are two flipsides of the hero archetype, they

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:55.900
are.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:01.600
The hero archetype has two basic elements.
One is the confrontation of the terrible aspect

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:07.700
of nature, chaos in its most brutal form,
and the other is the confrontation with the

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.290
archaic aspect of culture. And in some ways,
those aren’t distinguishable because if

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:18.490
culture isn’t archaic, chaos never makes
itself present. So which is to say you can’t

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:25.490
separate out political degradation from environmental
degradation, say, it’s the same idea.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:33.190
So anyways, Horace has this great idea. He
needs his father, right, and I told you about

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:38.160
the same motif emerging in Pinocchio, we already
looked at that, right? Pinocchio doesn’t

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:43.450
become genuine until he risks his life saving
his father, alright, so the same thing is

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:47.450
happening in this particular situation. So
that’s pretty cool. So then you get the

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:53.030
situation where the Egyptians characterize
sovereignty as the capability to overcome

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:58.590
evil in the political domain, combined with
– and that’s a youthful capability, right

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:03.890
– combined with the wisdom of the past,
alright? Then you look at that from a political

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:08.930
perspective and you find out already that
the Egyptians viewed the pharaoh as the live

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.870
pharaoh and the dead pharaoh simultaneously.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.620
But then you find out something else that’s
interesting and it gives you some real insight

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:19.700
into just exactly how bloody powerful these
ideas were. So you think: what did the Egyptians

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:24.300
do with their spare time? And then you think:
well, they built the pyramids, right, I mean

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:30.790
and that was no trivial undertaking. It was
sort of the 5000 B.C. equivalent of flying

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:34.880
to Mars. And I mean the pyramids are pretty
impressive now but they were a hell of a lot

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.500
more impressive in their original form because
they were in the middle of an immense complex.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:45.370
And the pyramids were dedicated to the immortality
of the pharaoh and the pharaoh was possessed

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:51.870
by a spirit called Ka and Ka was his immortal
spirit and it was the union of Horace and

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:52.450
Osiris, OK?

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:59.450
So Egyptian society was dedicated to deifying
the immortal spirit of the pharaoh, the union

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:07.590
of Horace and Osiris. And it was the union
that gave the, it was this identification

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:14.310
with this union that gave the pharaoh a phenomenon
the Egyptians called Maat and Maat was like

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:19.750
truth or good order. And you could think about
it as conscience in a sense is if the pharaoh

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:26.750
was utilizing the union of Horace and Osiris,
then he would have an intuitive ability to

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:33.210
decide what the appropriate course of order
was. And so the Egyptians would say, for example,

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:37.010
when the pharaoh came into the court, they’d
say: the sun has risen by that they meant

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:42.530
the power that reigned over the dominion of
the night had arrived. They conceptualized

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:49.530
maat as the capacity to put order in the place
of chaos, essentially formally. So they assimilated

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.130
the union of Horace and Osiris with the capability
of putting order in the face of chaos. They

00:20:54.130 --> 00:21:00.320
regarded that as immortal and they spent all
of the excess resources of their society glorifying

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.990
that idea. And you think: you don’t produce
something like the pyramids without really

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:10.360
being possessed by an idea, right? This is
no trivial undertaking, it’s going over

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.250
a period of several hundred, if not several
thousand, years. That takes an awful lot of

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:19.480
work. So this idea of the immortality of the
union of Horace and Osiris and its association

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.830
with sovereignty was an absolutely potent
idea for the Egyptians. It gave their whole

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.590
culture motive force.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:30.810
OK, so the Egyptians thought: the pharaoh
is immortal and that’s the reason why and

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:34.750
we more or less partake in his immortality
by being his subjects. So that was a pretty

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:40.030
good deal. But then Eliade points out something
very interesting and this is called the democratization

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:46.240
of Osiris and what you found was that initially
there were certain symbolic presentations

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.260
representing the immortality of the pharaoh
that could only be used by the pharaoh. But

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:56.690
as Egyptian culture continued to develop,
then the symbolic representations of immortality

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:03.690
started to be adopted by the aristocracy.
Now what did that mean? It meant that this

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:11.040
process that the Egyptians had conceptualized
as integral to the order of the state was

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:16.550
no longer solely embodied in the hands of
the pharaoh, right? It had started to drift

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:22.470
down the power hierarchy into the aristocracy,
OK? Well then you think: what happens after

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:28.890
that? So by the end of Egyptian society, the
aristocrats were characterized by an identity

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:33.620
with the union of Horace and Osiris, right?
Sovereignty had started to spread itself out.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:38.910
And you think: what starts to happen with
the Greeks, right? The Greeks attribute sovereignty

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:44.700
to every male Greek. Barbarians, no. Women,
no. But at least all males, right? You get

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.780
a beginning of a democratic notion there.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:55.780
The Jews developing ideas that, if not derived
from Egypt, were at least similar in structure

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:05.240
to Egyptian ideas, say: not the aristocracy,
not the pharaoh but every individual has the

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:12.850
capacity of establishing a direct relationship
with the transcendent deity, right? Then you

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:17.910
have a Christian revolution that follows that
where the idea that sovereignty inheres in

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:23.350
the individual, is distributed to everyone,
right, everyone – male, female, criminal,

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:29.420
non-criminal, murderer, rapist, taxman, you
name it, sovereignty inheres within them.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:35.640
And it’s on that soil that our whole democratic
culture emerges – these unbelievably archaic

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:41.240
ideas, first acted out, right, first embodied
in ritual, first dramatized then only told

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:47.740
as stories, developing more and more coherence
over stretches of time of thousands of years,

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:54.480
not hundreds of years but thousands of years,
becoming more coherent, becoming more pointed,

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.480
becoming more relevant with regards to their
embodiment, then starting to become understood

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.680
explicitly and distributed to the entire society.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:09.680
And it’s on that ground that our world rests,
not on the ground of rationality, as established

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:19.420
in say Europe in 1500. What we have is much
more profound and solid and deep than any

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:27.160
mere rational construction. It’s a from
of government, an equilibrated state, so to

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:34.160
speak, that’s a consequence of an emergent,
if not evolutionary, at least social evolutionary

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:39.980
process. And I would say that it stems much
farther back than that because you can imagine

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:46.980
something like this. Look, if this ideal personality
that should be sovereign is represented by

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:52.670
the optimal combination of creativity and
traditionalism, say, if that’s the optimal

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:59.010
combination, and if we’re prepared to regard
that as optimal, if that’s a – if that’s

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:04.490
what you perceive when you perceive someone
that you respect and admire, then you could

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:10.540
say that success in our social hierarchies
is predicated on the degree to which you actually

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:17.140
embody that combination. And then you see
an interaction between individual success

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:21.620
and the social construction that would be
an interaction that extends over centuries

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:27.660
or even thousands of centuries so that as
these ideas become more and more developed,

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:33.930
we become more and more adapted to embodying
them as a consequence of evolutionary pressure.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.550
So it’s not just cultural, it’s also biological.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:43.320
So our political presuppositions rest on a
cultural basis which is unbelievably archaic,

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.660
resting in turn on something even lower than
that. And I think examples of that are those

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:53.360
that I’ve provided you with already. We
know, for example, that chimps who have to

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.150
live in a dominance hierarchy are very aggressive,
especially the males, but they’re also very

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:02.380
cooperative. So the males who are aggressive
spend a substantial amount of time repairing

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:07.910
social boundaries in the aftermath of an aggressive
incident because they’re just as concerned

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:14.160
with keeping the bloody hierarchy intact as
they are in climbing it. They have to be.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.920
And we know that even wolves won’t kill
a subordinate wolf once they’ve defeated

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.410
it. They allow the subordinate wolf to maintain
its own existence, right, they have this notion,

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:30.330
this procedural notion that – even those
entities that appear insignificant may, in

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:35.650
some manner that’s beyond speech, still
contribute to the integrity of the whole.

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:39.090
And that’s an idea that’s very much similar
to our notion that sovereignty inheres in

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:43.620
the individual, right? We’ve taken it further.
No matter what you do, even if you’re in

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:48.360
clear violation of the law, your rights remain
intact because no matter how outcast you are

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.440
and how apparently beyond redemption, your
existence may still contribute something to

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.410
the integrity of the whole. And as far as
I’m concerned, that doesn’t appear to

00:26:56.410 --> 00:27:02.360
be a metaphorical idea. If you dismiss it,
you cannot dismiss it without simultaneously

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:07.970
dismissing the ground on which our states
rest. And so then you have to ask yourself:

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:13.180
are you willing to do that? And if the answer
is no, well then you have to start to question

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.720
what it is that you actually believe, because
if you buy the doctrine of natural rights,

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:24.420
which you do, you act it out, then all of
this follows in its wake, or it rests on sand.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:31.420
And it bloody well better not rest on sand.
