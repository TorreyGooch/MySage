00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:02.377
So she's like a force of nature.

00:00:02.377 --> 00:00:05.046
And this is why the regime
is so afraid of her.

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:08.633
her charisma is so powerful
that even members of the armed forces,

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:09.634
have backed her.

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:12.846
That's, by the way,
one of the reasons why they had the access

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:17.600
to the documents
showing that they won the presidency,

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:21.730
because members in the military
were leaking these documents

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.566
to the opposition,
100 soldiers are in prison,

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.818
and they humiliate them
and they tortured them and so on,

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.904
because they are behind Maria Corina
and not behind

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.907
Maduro.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:43.585
You think?

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:47.172
Hello, everybody.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.424
My wife, Tammy, and I recently

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:52.427
had the privilege of touring through

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.513
Mexico and South America.

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.350
We didn't tour, obviously,
through the whole continent.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.397
We went to a couple places in Brazil
and to Chilean

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.942
and to Mexico
and I met some very interesting people

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:12.238
along the way, which is always something
that happens, including the gentleman

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:15.950
I'm talking to today,
Axel Kaiser, Baron, born Horn Haggard.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:21.873
He's a Chilean German lawyer, a master
in investments, Commerce and arbitration.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.711
Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy
from the University of Heidelberg

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:28.630
in Germany. It's a very good university.

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:29.923
He is

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:34.094
co-founder and president of the Foundation
for Progress in Chile,

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:37.889
one of the most influential free market
think tanks in Latin America.

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:41.017
He's also a senior fellow
at the Arch Bridge Institute

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:44.938
in Washington, and director
of the Friedrich Hayek Chair at Adolfo

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.068
I Business University from 2016 to 2024.

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:52.445
So why are we talking?

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:56.533
Well, I thought it would be good
to bring everyone an update

00:01:57.075 --> 00:02:02.580
on the political and ideological situation
in South America.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.041
Now, that's an impossible thing
to do, obviously,

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.294
in the course of a 90 minute podcast,
because it's very complicated

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:12.257
to talk about a whole continent
and much of what we focused on,

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:15.426
what was, to do with the events

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:19.139
that are transpiring in Venezuela, where?

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.308
The age old conflict between what's

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:26.563
essentially a crooked, corrupt,
propagandistic,

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:30.692
draconian communist totalitarian state

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:35.196
and the people and the opposition
to that state is transpiring.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:39.159
And so we walked through the situation
in Venezuela.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.910
There was a recent election there.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.956
The incumbent,
the aforementioned totalitarian Maduro,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.543
apparently lost, and

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:51.754
is very unlikely to give up power.

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:56.467
why should anyone care?

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.469
Well.

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.556
The world's a small place now,
and what happens everywhere

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.851
has an effect that's local.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:08.855
If South America's destabilized,
you can expect a lot more trouble.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.191
For example, at the southern US border.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.651
And by a lot, I mean a lot.

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.278
I mean millions of people.

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:18.281
And if the communist dystopian is

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:22.118
and they're Iranian, Chinese and Russian

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:25.955
propagandistic backers and troublemakers

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:29.250
get their way, there's going to be plenty
of dystopian South America.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.960
And don't be thinking

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.963
you're going to escape unscathed from that
because you're not.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.591
And so

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.009
we talked about Venezuela.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.304
We talked about Chile,
and we talked about Argentina and Chile,

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.972
the new government there.

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:45.350
And so

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.268
we talked about different schools

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:51.022
of economics as well,
and what influence they all had in the way

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:55.318
that geopolitical affairs
play themselves out. So

00:03:56.694 --> 00:03:58.321
join us for that. And.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:02.700
Learn along with me about what's
transpiring with our southern neighbors

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:06.537
Well, Doctor Kaiser,
let's just jump right into it.

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:08.331
Let's talk about Venezuela.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.458
Maybe you can give people

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:13.044
a bit of an update
about the current situation,

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.421
and then we could delve
into that historically,

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:20.176
and then we'll move into the topic
of South and Central America more broadly.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.596
So give us your thoughts on Venezuela.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.601
a very, you know, sad situation
we are living now.

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:32.647
I started my career in Venezuela,
in Caracas, back in 2005.

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:37.694
I was, starting the socialist revolution,
in Caracas.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:42.699
And I came to the conclusion
that, Chavez had come to power

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.370
and he would never leave, which is what
usually socialist, dictators do.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.581
And, at the time, my friends in

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:53.626
Venezuela had the hope that they could,
vote him out.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.129
It never happened. As we all know.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.506
And what we really are experiencing

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:04.595
is the, consequences
of decades of socialism.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:08.766
you can vote socialists in,
but you cannot vote them out.

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:10.184
This is one of the main lessons

00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:13.896
that you that you have in Venezuela,
especially if you have weak institutions.

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:17.483
And what we do have now, it's
a horrible regime.

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:22.864
It's a tyrannical dictatorship
that has been there for decades already.

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:26.576
And Maduro is, systematically

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:30.330
engaging in human rights violation
He stole the election.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.456
We all know that.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:38.087
a couple of weeks ago and the, French
we have there,

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:41.716
they are fighting on the ground,
literally risking their lives.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:46.596
a good friend of mine
was recently arrested by their mother.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:52.226
A regime with no, 
you know, warrant or whatever.

00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:54.812
I mean, just
the police came to her house.

00:05:54.812 --> 00:06:00.526
They took her to, to prison,
and who knows what they are doing to her.

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:03.946
And just because she was posting
some content on social media

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.786
and, the problem that, Venezuela poses
for the whole region and not only,

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:14.123
Latin America, but also the United States,
is that the Maduro regime?

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.168
It's a big narco dictatorship.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:20.671
So they are in bed with the cartel
de Los Solis.

00:06:20.671 --> 00:06:24.467
They are running the soulless cartel,
which is the Sun Cartel.

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.971
And, 
they are exporting, cocaine everywhere.

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:33.601
And not only that, they are in bed
with the Iranian regime and with Russia.

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:38.106
So they are being supported
by Russia, Iran, and also by China.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:42.235
So I think this poses a security
threat to the United States

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:47.573
because they have, you know,
Hezbollah has training camps in Venezuela.

00:06:48.032 --> 00:06:52.203
And any
if you have this open borders with Mexico,

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:56.749
I'm sure they have infiltrated people
coming from Venezuela to the United States

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:00.253
that are not their regular criminals
that you can see

00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:03.256
nowadays operating in New York
or other parts in the United States.

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:05.883
These are also Islamic terrorists.

00:07:05.883 --> 00:07:09.053
I'm pretty sure
that you have some of them now,

00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:12.223
that came from Venezuela via Mexico
into the United States.

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.183
So this is a dramatic situation.

00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:16.310
And I have a message
from the group of Maria

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.980
Guerrero, my child,
because I've been in contact with them.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.607
She's the opposition
leader. She's a good friend of mine.

00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:24.694
to the international

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:29.449
media, they are really very upset,
by the way, that the press,

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:33.161
in the Western world
has been covering all this.

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:37.540
And they have a double standard
when it comes to left wing dictatorships

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:42.295
as compared to not left wing or right
wing dictators, dictatorships.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:47.216
And, you have several newspapers
like El Pais in Spain, for instance,

00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:50.887
that have called Maria Claudia machado
a far right extremist,

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.763
which is complete nonsense.

00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:55.766
She is fighting for freedom
and democracy.

00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:58.227
and then you have other media

00:07:58.227 --> 00:08:01.230
like the New York Times
who have been very biased as well.

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:04.817
And they, sent me a message

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:08.696
and I'm using this platform, and
they thank you, Yordan, for this interview

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:12.325
because, they need the support
of the international community.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:16.621
If you want a transition
to happen in Venezuela, which is looking

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:20.666
increasingly
unlikely with the passing of time.

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:24.378
so it's very sad.

00:08:24.378 --> 00:08:27.381
And this is poisoning
the whole of the region, the whole region.

00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:32.428
And also, I think it's going to be
a big problem for the United States

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:35.640
if we if they don't push enough
to get rid of Maduro right now,

00:08:36.557 --> 00:08:39.560
for the reasons I already mentioned.

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:41.521
All right. So there's a lot in.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.730
In what you just said.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.358
So let me take it apart piece by piece.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.484
You said, for example,

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:49.529
that if you vote in the socialists,
you don't get to vote them out.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:53.032
And so we probably want
to draw a distinction

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:58.371
or at least have a discussion
about socialism versus communism,

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:03.793
or a discussion about whether or not
that distinction is even reasonable.

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:08.130
It's it's definitely the case
that in some Western countries,

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.466
more left leaning regimes

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:13.344
are voted in and voted out

00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:16.347
with some degree of regularity.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:20.893
Canada has a socialist party,
the New Democratic Party,

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:26.649
and it has never won an election federally
and is unlikely ever to do so.

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:27.233
I would say,

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:31.112
because it never seems to gain about more
than about 20% of the population.

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:35.074
But it's certainly run many provinces

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:38.077
and, you know, often

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:41.497
not cataclysmic,
sometimes even intelligently,

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:46.961
depending on who it was
that was running the show, let's say so.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.756
And then, of course,
people tend to presume that countries like

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:55.136
Sweden and Denmark
and Norway are socialist countries,

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:59.932
even though fundamentally
they adhere to free market principles.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:04.520
So do you want to distinguish first
for maybe some definitions?

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.939
What do you think
the difference is between

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:09.233
a socialist country
and a communist country?

00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:13.821
And how, how
or how should people draw a distinction?

00:10:15.364 --> 00:10:18.367
distinguish between social democracy,
which is,

00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:23.289
you know, on the left
that we have usually in the Western world,

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:26.292
in the developed nations, people like,

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:30.129
Biden or people like,

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:34.634
you know, Justin Trudeau,
people like that who can be very far left

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:38.387
when it comes to, their woke issues

00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:41.557
and all of this value conflicts
that we have now in the West.

00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:44.769
And I believe that they are responsible
for endorsing an ideology

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:48.189
that will end up destroying the West
if they are successful in the end.

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:51.859
But they are not this
revolutionary socialist that we have now,

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.488
in, in Latin America,
or that we used to have

00:10:55.488 --> 00:11:00.618
in the Western world during the Cold War,
like you had them in Italy and France.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:01.744
You had them in Germany.

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:03.621
You had terrorist groups
that were fighting

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:07.416
against the establishment being funded
by the Soviet Union and so on.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.252
So I would make a distinction there.

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:14.507
and also, if you have countries
with more solid institutions,

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:20.096
even within Latin American,
they are never able to achieve their goal

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:24.684
of concentrating power in their own hands,
like Chile is a good example of that.

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:27.812
We had a constitutional referendum
a couple of years ago,

00:11:28.145 --> 00:11:32.024
and the left proposed a
very radical constitution,

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:36.278
a very woke constitution,
but at the same time, communist

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:40.032
constitution and over 60% of Chileans
voted against that.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:45.454
So we were saved by, by this decision,
in the referendum.

00:11:45.454 --> 00:11:49.125
So they failed in their attempt
to, you know, control power.

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:52.294
so I would say and in the

00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:57.007
classical, definition of socialism
and Marxism used to

00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:00.803
or communism, they used to be more or less
the same during the Cold War.

00:12:01.011 --> 00:12:04.932
I mean, it would be hard to argue,
that the Socialist,

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:08.436
was not at the same time,
someone who believed in the,

00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:12.648
in the Soviet Union type of system,
central plant economy.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.276
This is, point that Hayek and Mrs.

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:18.738
were making during the Cold War
fighting against the socialists

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:22.116
because the sources, socialists
were arguing for the central

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:25.494
plant economy,
which in the end would have destroyed

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:29.582
all sort of, political liberties
and democracy, as well.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:35.212
So, I would distinguish more,
as I said, between the Social Democrats

00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:40.176
and within the Social Democrats, you have
you have also, more extreme

00:12:40.384 --> 00:12:45.306
type of people than others
and the socialists and communists.

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:49.185
And even if some political parties
have the name of socialists

00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:54.148
nowadays, they are more
like social democrats than true socialists

00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:57.610
that are inspired 100%
by the Marxist and Leninist doctrine

00:12:58.068 --> 00:13:01.739
that they, followed in the,
in the times of the cold War.

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:05.075
So that's a distinction I would make.

00:13:05.075 --> 00:13:08.162
So what we could say,
just to clarify this further

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:12.124
for everybody watching and listening,
is that in countries like,

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:15.961
I think the Scandinavian countries
are probably the best example of this.

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:19.006
The first thing we should note is that
they're relatively small countries.

00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:23.344
And until recently they were
relatively homogenous ethnically.

00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:26.639
And that makes governance
more straightforward.

00:13:27.097 --> 00:13:30.518
The systems simply aren't as complex
because there are fewer people, and

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:33.354
there is more of, implicit

00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:37.191
consensus on which way is up
and which way is down, let's say.

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:40.194
But the Scandinavian countries
like Canada,

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:45.032
the classic socialists,
we're really free market

00:13:45.032 --> 00:13:49.245
people of things considered believed in
private property, more or less.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:54.124
And but we're more interested
than the libertarians or the conservatives

00:13:54.124 --> 00:14:00.005
in producing a, a broad
and encompassing social safety net.

00:14:00.798 --> 00:14:04.301
And so most of the political action
in Canada had to do

00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:08.222
with the expansion
of the social safety net.

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:12.142
And that was what the left wingers
and the labor union types

00:14:12.142 --> 00:14:13.561
were pushing for, with,

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:18.023
with a certain degree of success
and the the distinction you're drawing on.

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:21.527
And you referred to a couple of Austrian
economists, Hayek and Mrs..

00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:27.366
Is that the communists go full fledged
planned economy, the full fledged planned

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:31.620
economy route, and they are not in favor
of private property.

00:14:31.912 --> 00:14:35.332
They believe that an untrammeled free
market,

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.836
it ends up concentrating economic power
in the hands

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:42.882
of a very small number of people,
and that replacing that with a planned

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:46.552
economy would fix that problem,
which it certainly doesn't and can't.

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:51.724
And I know the Austrians who you referred
to, also make the case that

00:14:52.474 --> 00:14:55.311
a planned
economy is something that appeals

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:59.356
to people who are very presumptuous
in their intellect, because

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:02.192
the fabrication of any

00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:06.280
given commodity consumer item,
let's say, or commodity for that

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.743
matter, is complex, almost beyond,
well, it's complex beyond comprehend.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:16.540
And unless you have a distributed system
of pricing to make rational, intelligent

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.628
decisions, your economy will eventually
grind to a cataclysmic halt.

00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:23.964
So I think about it
as a computational problem.

00:15:23.964 --> 00:15:24.214
Right.

00:15:24.214 --> 00:15:27.551
Is that the
and I think this fits in very well

00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:30.554
with the Austrian economists
line of thinking is like,

00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:35.809
do you want to have a distributed network
of computation,

00:15:36.143 --> 00:15:38.812
each person calculating their own

00:15:38.812 --> 00:15:41.482
hierarchy of values, each person

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:45.027
with the eyes on the particulars
of their local situation,

00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:50.658
sum all that together
in some distributed manner,

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:54.787
and allow decisions to be made that way or
do you want to put decision making power

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:59.875
in the hands of a small group of people
who can't hope to know what's going on?

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:02.920
You know, I think the Central Committee,
the Soviet Central

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.548
Committee, was making something like 300
pricing decisions a day.

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:09.551
And like, I've run companies

00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:12.763
where we've tried to price our offerings
and just pricing.

00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:15.516
One thing is almost impossible.

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:18.727
And you have to do that in concert
with your market.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:19.645
You don't know

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.315
what something is worth.

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:26.568
The best you could do is find out
what people are willing to pay for it,

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:30.197
given all the other things that they're
trying to accomplish simultaneously.

00:16:30.197 --> 00:16:34.785
So okay, so the communist types,
they're focusing on planned economy.

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:37.788
Now let's go back to Venezuela.

00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:42.292
So before the socialist revolution
took place, in your opinion,

00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:45.546
how was Venezuela doing?

00:18:14.676 --> 00:18:16.386
So Venezuela is an interesting case

00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:20.349
because it had the highest per capita
income in Latin America in 1970.

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:24.603
And it was, the country
of the largest degree of economic freedom.

00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:26.814
you can measure that.

00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:31.026
the Fraser Institute in Canada does
that work of measuring economic freedom.

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:35.197
And in 1970, Venezuela was 14,

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:39.368
14 in the world
in terms of economic freedom, it was about

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:42.204
like 90 countries, more or less,
that they were measuring back then.

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.249
Chile was one of the last countries

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:48.460
because we had had the socialist
experiment of sort of other agenda,

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.047
which was an attempt to impose
a totalitarian communist system in Chile.

00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:55.509
And we were last in the country,
and we had hyperinflation

00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:58.887
and scarcity of basic goods and services
and so on and so forth.

00:18:58.887 --> 00:19:02.349
So it was a complete catastrophe
that ended up in the coup

00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:05.519
of 1973, led by General Pinochet.

00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:08.814
But Venezuela, over time
and over the decades,

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:12.568
especially after they nationalized
in the 70s, the oil industry.

00:19:13.026 --> 00:19:17.072
We have to remember, Venezuela has one
of the largest oil reserves in the world.

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:20.826
they nationalized it
and they started falling

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.163
in the ranking of economic freedom
systematically.

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:28.000
So by the time Chavez came to power in
1988, Venezuela

00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:31.336
was doing very poorly
in the rankings of economic freedom.

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:35.757
You had a very kleptocratic,
kleptocratic, corrupt, system

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:39.761
that, you know, a rent seeking society.

00:19:39.761 --> 00:19:44.474
Let's say everyone was trying to live out
of the government hands on handouts and

00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:49.313
and corrupt deals between the corporate
interests and the politicians.

00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:52.983
And, Chavez was, elected.

00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:56.904
He had been, a military, a soldier

00:19:56.904 --> 00:20:01.491
who had attempted a coup in 1992
against Carlos Andres Perez.

00:20:01.491 --> 00:20:04.953
So, so he was a gold star,
what we call a gold star in Spanish.

00:20:04.953 --> 00:20:08.999
So, someone who tried to overthrow
a democratically elected

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:12.836
president, and install a, dictatorship.

00:20:12.836 --> 00:20:14.546
So everyone knew who Chavez was.

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:17.966
So many people died in 1992,
and he ended up in prison.

00:20:18.508 --> 00:20:21.011
But, well meaning

00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:23.972
central leftist in, Venezuela.

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:27.184
pardon him so he could go out of jail.

00:20:27.434 --> 00:20:30.437
And then he went to see Fidel Castro.

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:35.901
And Fidel Castro recognized immediately
that he had,

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:40.697
you know, a puppet that he could guide in
order to, to take control over Venezuela.

00:20:41.114 --> 00:20:43.867
So Castro and Cuba, they have been

00:20:43.867 --> 00:20:47.829
the masterminds behind
what is going on, in this country.

00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:50.916
And they have, you know,

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:54.044
extracted
huge sums of wealth from Venezuela,

00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:57.839
because after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, at some point Russia stopped

00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:00.842
funding, Cuban, the Cuban dictatorship.

00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:04.513
And so Venezuela and played that role.

00:21:04.554 --> 00:21:07.557
And Chavez had saw in Fidel

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.852
Castro a father figure for him.

00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:13.355
And this is really an important,

00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:16.566
thing because he was loyal to Fidel
until the very end.

00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:21.280
And the intelligence services from Cuba,
who are very effective,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.784
we have to say, in consolidating power,
they have been there in Cuba

00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:26.827
for over 60 years.

00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:29.204
So they know what they're doing.

00:21:29.204 --> 00:21:33.292
These are the people advising the regime
as to what to do,

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:37.546
to deal with the opposition and to purge
the military and things like that.

00:21:38.046 --> 00:21:43.051
but Venezuela was already,
in a situation where they have

00:21:43.176 --> 00:21:47.306
where they have lost, their economic
freedom and the per capita incomes

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:51.310
as compared to other countries in Latin
America started to fall dramatically.

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:55.147
And while Chile embraced
free market reforms,

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:58.233
especially influenced
by the Chicago School of Economics, Milton

00:21:58.233 --> 00:22:02.070
Friedman and Arnold Harburg
or George Stigler and people like that,

00:22:02.612 --> 00:22:06.575
and we became the wealthiest country
in per capita terms in Latin America.

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:10.412
And, so you can see that,

00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:14.166
in the 70s, Chile was at the bottom
of the economic freedom ranking.

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:17.419
We went up to the top,
even top ten at some point,

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:20.464
and we became the wealthiest country
in Latin America

00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:24.634
and Venezuela, the complete opposite
that went from being the first country

00:22:24.634 --> 00:22:28.472
in Latin America
to now the last country in the ranking

00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:32.642
in the world, 162
among 162 countries that are measured.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.020
And it's a complete disaster.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.772
And and this is socialism.

00:22:36.772 --> 00:22:37.564
This is what I mean.

00:22:37.564 --> 00:22:41.068
So the Nordic countries are really on
the top,

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:44.112
countries in terms of economic freedom.

00:22:44.112 --> 00:22:46.448
These are not really socialist countries.

00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:48.950
And I remember Bernie Sanders
saying this all the time.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.952
And and he got a response.

00:22:50.952 --> 00:22:54.289
I think it was a prime minister
from Sweden who told him, we are

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.043
we are not socialist
because you have corporate tax in,

00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:00.462
in, in Sweden
that is lower than in the United States,

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:02.506
more or less 
in some of these Nordic countries.

00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:07.260
Do you have so what they do is they tax
very heavily for personal income.

00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:07.719
Right.

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:11.765
And this is I don't like it
because you have lots of, capital,

00:23:11.932 --> 00:23:14.309
human capital flight,
people who are very qualified,

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:16.228
who go to the United States
for other parts,

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:18.980
but still
they're very productive countries

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.566
and they have very large degrees
of economic freedom.

00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:25.362
And economic freedom means free trade,
stable currency, protection

00:23:25.362 --> 00:23:29.157
of property rights, 
reasonable size of government and so on.

00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:33.203
so it is it is a social democracy

00:23:33.537 --> 00:23:36.665
like, 
Anthony Giddens type of social democracy.

00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:39.918
What Tony Blair and Bill Clinton
where at the time, at some point or German

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:43.505
Chancellor or Gerhard Schroeder,
who who made all the reforms in Germany,

00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:48.885
allowing Germany in the 2002
to then experience,

00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:53.348
a boom and economic boom,
that merkel benefited from that.

00:23:53.598 --> 00:23:53.974
Okay.

00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:57.727
So, so but here
what we have is the extreme far

00:23:57.727 --> 00:24:00.897
left experiments,
that are very anti-capitalist.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.985
And this is, what you see in Venezuela

00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:09.072
now is the consolidation of this ideology.

00:24:09.698 --> 00:24:14.202
And we have to remember that Maduro
was chosen by Chavez as his successor.

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:18.874
And the reason for this was that Maduro
compared to the del Cabello,

00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:23.044
who is another criminal
and one of the main leaders of this

00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:27.299
soulless cartel,
Maduro is is a doctrinaire.

00:24:27.424 --> 00:24:29.885
He was the hardcore socialist,

00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:33.096
and he was following a first minister
to the Chavez administration,

00:24:33.513 --> 00:24:36.892
and he was instrumental in building up

00:24:36.892 --> 00:24:39.895
the whole network of, of Venezuela.

00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:45.108
And that Chavez more in an international
on an international level in Europe,

00:24:45.484 --> 00:24:48.403
in, in, in Asia in different parts.

00:24:48.403 --> 00:24:52.240
And, and Chavez aligned himself
very rapidly

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.826
with, Russia and with Iran and with China.

00:24:56.244 --> 00:24:56.828
so, so

00:24:56.828 --> 00:25:00.749
this is part of the Cold War 2.0
that we are experiencing.

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:04.002
Venezuela is playing for them and

00:25:04.211 --> 00:25:07.631
and now we have

00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:10.717
and I want to stress this, Jordan,
because it's important,

00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:14.471
you have a minimum
wage of $3 in Venezuela.

00:25:14.804 --> 00:25:17.807
You have accumulated inflation
of 2,000,000% or more.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:23.313
You have, collapse of 70% of GDP, 70%.

00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:27.984
You have a collapse of over 80%
of oil production in Venezuela.

00:25:28.652 --> 00:25:32.197
And they have squandered
almost $1 trillion

00:25:32.822 --> 00:25:35.825
and and wealth,
because when Chavez came to power,

00:25:36.284 --> 00:25:39.788
you had a barrel of oil at $8 or so,

00:25:40.247 --> 00:25:45.085
and it it skyrocketed to over $120.

00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:48.964
So only because of that,
they got almost $1 trillion.

00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:51.258
They destroyed all all of that wealth.

00:25:51.258 --> 00:25:53.969
And people say, oh, this is,
you know, Caribbean type of politics.

00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:57.138
This is the result of socialism everywhere
you go.

00:25:57.138 --> 00:26:00.392
And you see what the socialists,
when they implement this system.

00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:03.645
And again, I don't mean the Nordic type
of welfare state,

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:06.982
which is not socialism,
not real socialism, at least,

00:26:07.274 --> 00:26:11.278
they, they destroy the country
where they, where they run it.

00:26:11.319 --> 00:26:13.738
It's, it's
you can see it in eastern Germany

00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:16.741
as compared to western Germany
during the Cold War.

00:26:16.783 --> 00:26:19.578
It was a very poor country
compared to western Germany and so on.

00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:22.914
I mean, everyone knows the different
examples North Korea, South Korea

00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:24.708
and so on and so forth.

00:26:24.708 --> 00:26:27.711
But it's important to remember that,

00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:30.714
Fidel Castro, Cuba

00:26:30.755 --> 00:26:33.717
and Russia, Vladimir Putin

00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:36.720
and Iran, Hezbollah are behind Maduro.

00:26:37.053 --> 00:26:38.597
I have to stress this because

00:26:39.806 --> 00:26:42.309
this is not only a Venezuelan problem.

00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:46.563
This is going to be a crucial problem
for the United States

00:26:46.563 --> 00:26:50.775
and for national security in the United
Well let's dig into that one of the other.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:56.031
So there's there's three four things
I'd like to cover as we move forward.

00:26:56.031 --> 00:26:57.449
Right now.

00:26:57.449 --> 00:27:00.452
I want to talk
more about the opposition in Venezuela

00:27:00.493 --> 00:27:06.249
and what you think people outside
Venezuela can do to aid the opposition.

00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:09.586
I want to talk about the ordinary life
of the typical Venezuelan.

00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:12.922
Now, I want to talk about where
that trillion dollars went.

00:27:13.214 --> 00:27:14.716
And maybe we can do that.

00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:19.638
We'll talking about your claim,
for example, that the Maduro government

00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:23.433
has basically also become a narco
dictatorship.

00:27:23.683 --> 00:27:28.188
Now, you know, you made a variety
of extremely serious allegations.

00:27:28.188 --> 00:27:31.733
The misuse of $1 trillion
certainly being one of them.

00:27:32.108 --> 00:27:34.861
But then you also said, well,
the Maduro government is in

00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:37.864
bed with, with the narco cartels.

00:27:37.864 --> 00:27:42.077
And see, I don't think people in North
America exactly understand what that means

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:47.290
or exactly how nefarious
those cartels are, and what a danger

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:51.044
they pose well, to the stability
of the entire Western Hemisphere.

00:27:51.378 --> 00:27:56.841
But then you also added to that
the fact that Maduro is in cahoots

00:27:56.841 --> 00:28:01.846
with, well, Cuba, Iran, Russia
and then Hezbollah.

00:28:02.222 --> 00:28:06.351
And so this is a lot for people to digest,

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:12.065
because it sounds like a stew generated
by a conspiracy theorist in a sense.

00:28:12.065 --> 00:28:17.862
Right, because there's almost nothing
that is bad that you're not

00:28:19.239 --> 00:28:22.158
accusing the Maduro government
of participating in.

00:28:22.158 --> 00:28:28.039
And so the easiest thing for a listener
to do is to just say no to all that.

00:28:28.289 --> 00:28:31.584
So we should walk through those issues
one by one.

00:28:31.626 --> 00:28:35.839
I guess the thing I'm most curious about
to begin with, let's do it in this order.

00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:39.259
What the hell happened to $1 trillion?

00:28:39.843 --> 00:28:40.969
That's an awful lot of money.

00:28:40.969 --> 00:28:45.140
Where where do you think most of that,
especially given that you have a 70%

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.728
collapse in GDP
and an 80% reduction in oil production?

00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:50.186
It's like.

00:28:50.186 --> 00:28:54.858
And then everybody in Venezuela is poor,
and yet $1 trillion came pouring in.

00:28:54.858 --> 00:28:59.446
So what's your sense
of who that money went to.

00:28:59.446 --> 00:29:00.613
And like what

00:29:00.613 --> 00:29:04.784
sort of people did that money go to
and what are they doing with that money?

00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:09.372
the money funded some very existentialist

00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:12.959
social programs at some point
during the Chavez administration.

00:29:13.543 --> 00:29:17.672
but a large part of it went to fund,

00:29:17.672 --> 00:29:20.717
revolutionary groups and political parties
all over Latin America.

00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:23.720
We have to remember that
the Castro vision,

00:29:23.845 --> 00:29:28.057
which is the important, figure,
I think, here

00:29:28.224 --> 00:29:32.562
the Castro mission was to spread
the revolution all over Latin America.

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:35.607
And in his, worldview,

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:40.361
what he was doing,
believe it or not, is, Chris

00:29:40.361 --> 00:29:44.741
Christ's work on, on earth
like he was bringing Paradise to earth.

00:29:44.824 --> 00:29:46.910
He said that literally many times.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:50.914
So Castro had been educated
by the Jesuits in Cuba,

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:55.543
and he believed that capitalism and,
you know,

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:59.714
liberal democracy, individualism
were the sources of corruption,

00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:04.928
that Christ was the first communist
revolutionary.

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:08.973
And this is, by the way,
something very similar to what Pope

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:10.809
Francis said at some point

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:15.063
when he argued that it was the Communist
who thought like the Christians.

00:30:15.063 --> 00:30:18.900
He said that literally, Pope Francis,
who is, I guess, with himself.

00:30:19.567 --> 00:30:22.695
So and Castro was promising,
to create this,

00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:26.157
but this had to be
an expansionist project.

00:30:26.407 --> 00:30:29.953
So when Chavez came to power
and he had all of these resources as,

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.748
in her in his pockets,

00:30:33.748 --> 00:30:36.751
plenty of them went to Cuba, of course,
to sustain the island.

00:30:36.751 --> 00:30:39.754
But then he started supporting different,

00:30:40.129 --> 00:30:45.093
regimes or movements and terrorist
organizations all over Latin America.

00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:48.304
At some point,
I had this conversation, conversation

00:30:48.304 --> 00:30:51.182
with former President Alberto Reeb,
who is also a good friend.

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:54.102
At some point
he told me I was the only non leftist,

00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:57.939
non socialist, 
president in most of, South America.

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:04.028
And it's true, and all of these regimes,
even the Kirchner dynasty in dynasty

00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:10.034
in Argentina, the corrupt Kirchner dynasty
got some, you know, loans, special

00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:13.121
loans from the Venezuelan government
when they needed money. So.

00:31:13.413 --> 00:31:15.164
And they stole a lot of money.

00:31:15.164 --> 00:31:19.669
I mean, they have the travesties and
their families have billions of dollars,

00:31:20.253 --> 00:31:22.839
in and on bank accounts,

00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:26.384
in, in Europe, 
in the US in different parts.

00:31:26.843 --> 00:31:29.929
And, and so, it's amazing

00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:34.309
you saw Ferraris in, in Caracas
while people were starving.

00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:35.935
You have a almost 8

00:31:35.935 --> 00:31:39.188
million people have left Venezuela
because you don't find things to eat.

00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:42.442
8 million is a quarter of the population

00:31:42.442 --> 00:31:46.654
who have fled, left the country
because of the, desperate situation.

00:31:46.946 --> 00:31:49.949
And you have over 80% poverty rate.

00:31:50.366 --> 00:31:52.368
And, and so,

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.454
a large

00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:58.291
part of the money, as I said,
went to fund all of this, movement,

00:31:58.291 --> 00:32:04.547
but also within Venezuela, they started
creating a parallel army, the circus.

00:32:04.547 --> 00:32:07.926
What you are Janos Chavez
very early on, understood,

00:32:08.343 --> 00:32:11.262
probably
because Castro advised him to do so,

00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:14.265
that he needed a parallel troops

00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:19.395
in order to contain any threat
that could come from the within the army.

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:20.480
And he was right.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.734
In 2002, 
the army staged a coup against Chavez,

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.237
and Chavez was, taken into custody.

00:32:28.237 --> 00:32:30.156
He was imprisoned.

00:32:30.156 --> 00:32:33.993
But then some generals,
you know, regretted the decision of,

00:32:33.993 --> 00:32:35.703
getting rid of him.

00:32:35.703 --> 00:32:37.956
And they reinstalled Chavez.

00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:40.833
And then he, of course, used the muscle

00:32:40.833 --> 00:32:44.587
of the intelligence services of Cuba to
to purge the military as much as he could.

00:32:44.587 --> 00:32:49.300
But he was never entirely sure that there
would not be traitors within the army.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.387
So he created this circular value,
Mariano's, which are armed.

00:32:52.387 --> 00:32:56.140
And these are the guys, by the way,
that you see nowadays in the videos

00:32:56.474 --> 00:33:00.269
and in the videos attacking, Venezuelans
from the opposition

00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:04.107
who are just protesting on the streets
and they are shooting at them,

00:33:04.107 --> 00:33:06.818
they are taking them in
and torturing them.

00:33:06.818 --> 00:33:09.278
Most of the people doing the dirty job

00:33:09.278 --> 00:33:12.156
are these, Cyclospora arenas,

00:33:12.156 --> 00:33:15.743
which is the Bolivarian
circles, you know, and so

00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:17.912
and that's,

00:33:17.912 --> 00:33:20.915
a lot of money that went there also.

00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:24.002
And, you know,
you can squander wealth with no end.

00:33:24.002 --> 00:33:27.505
I mean, it's it's, if you are 
if you are supporting other countries

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.718
and you want to install regimes
all over Latin America that are favorable,

00:33:31.926 --> 00:33:35.763
favorable to you, I mean, $1
trillion is not even a lot of money.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.976
you know, but the worst part
and I finished the point with this

00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:43.021
is that we saw people all over the West,

00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:46.566
in the 2000, when it was already clear
that Chavez was a dictator,

00:33:46.566 --> 00:33:50.611
that he was completely undermining the,
separation of powers.

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:55.867
He was imprisoning, of the opposition,
and he was violating human rights

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:56.743
and so on.

00:33:56.743 --> 00:34:00.621
We saw very famous people
like Joseph Stiglitz, for instance,

00:34:01.414 --> 00:34:05.626
coming to Venezuela
and praising Chavez for what he was doing.

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:10.631
And he did the same, by the way,
with Kirchner's with, Fidel Castro.

00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:14.385
he has been a long time
supporter of the Castro dictatorship,

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:17.889
and he now writes
books called The Road to Freedom

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.684
and and and pretense
pretends to be the savior of of the West

00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:25.563
or or the killer or the undertaker
of Leon liberalism or something like that.

00:34:25.813 --> 00:34:27.398
But you could read the New York Times,

00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:31.444
you could read different BBC,
you could see different news.

00:34:31.444 --> 00:34:35.823
media outlets or even on television.

00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:38.951
They were sympathetic to Chavez
when he started doing this,

00:34:38.951 --> 00:34:41.954
and it was already clear
where he was going.

00:34:42.121 --> 00:34:46.209
So, I, I share the frustration
of the Venezuelan friends

00:34:46.209 --> 00:34:51.464
in the resistance because, 
the West has not, shown, you know,

00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:54.842
one standard for everyone when it
when it's the leftist,

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:59.639
they, they, they support them
or they turn a blind eye to what

00:35:02.517 --> 00:35:05.520
Are you tired of feeling sluggish, rundown
or just not your best self?

00:35:05.728 --> 00:35:08.856
Take control of your health
and vitality today with balance of nature.

00:35:09.065 --> 00:35:09.941
With balance of nature.

00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:12.276
There's never been a more convenient
dietary supplement

00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:15.279
to ensure you get a wide variety of fruits
and vegetables every day.

00:35:15.363 --> 00:35:17.281
Balance of nature
takes fruits and vegetables.

00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:17.782
They freeze,

00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:21.077
dry them, turn them into a powder,
and then they put them into a capsule.

00:35:21.244 --> 00:35:23.162
The capsules are completely devoid
of additives.

00:35:23.162 --> 00:35:26.582
Fillers, extract synthetics, pesticides,
or added sugar.

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:29.877
The only thing in balance of nature fruit
and veggie capsules are fruits

00:35:29.877 --> 00:35:30.711
and veggies.

00:35:56.279 --> 00:35:58.281
Okay, so let's talk about.

00:35:58.281 --> 00:36:00.241
Let's move from that.

00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:03.077
So you accounted for a fair
bit of the spending?

00:36:03.077 --> 00:36:07.582
A lot of it has disappeared
into the pockets of corrupt politicians.

00:36:07.748 --> 00:36:09.500
You see exactly the same thing.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.752
For example,
with the Palestinian leadership,

00:36:11.752 --> 00:36:14.839
all of those people end up with
billions of dollars in their accounts.

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:18.092
And so that's appalling
beyond comprehension.

00:36:18.092 --> 00:36:22.972
They sacrifice their own people
and they often live elsewhere.

00:36:22.972 --> 00:36:27.351
And so the socialist redistribution
of wealth ends up meaning that everyone's

00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:31.147
much more poor than they used to be,
except the small minority of people

00:36:31.147 --> 00:36:33.900
who have power
instead of the evil capitalists,

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.986
and they have untold wealth
at their fingertips.

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:40.072
And then you also said
the money was distributed

00:36:40.072 --> 00:36:44.702
around South America and Central America
to destabilize

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:48.331
and to promote revolution,
and maybe elsewhere in the world as well.

00:36:48.789 --> 00:36:49.165
Okay.

00:36:49.165 --> 00:36:50.082
So, so

00:36:50.082 --> 00:36:50.958
and that you can spend

00:36:50.958 --> 00:36:53.961
an awful lot of money doing that
and cause an awful lot of trouble.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:57.506
And you also pointed out
that that's been aided and abetted by the

00:36:57.798 --> 00:37:01.344
what would you call them
useful idiots of the Western media.

00:37:01.594 --> 00:37:03.846
And so we'll we'll get back to that.

00:37:03.846 --> 00:37:08.351
Let's turn to the
another element of the corruption.

00:37:08.351 --> 00:37:12.230
And that's the you described Maduro
as as a narco

00:37:12.688 --> 00:37:15.233
at the Maduro regime, as a narco
dictatorship.

00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:18.819
So talked to everyone,
if you would, a little bit about the

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:23.282
role of the cartels
in Central and South America,

00:37:23.282 --> 00:37:27.662
because that's not something that's
well understood in North America at all.

00:37:29.205 --> 00:37:31.040
way, people who.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.085
Who think I'm making these things up,
they can Google it.

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:35.127
It's all online.

00:37:35.127 --> 00:37:40.591
This is, you can see in very serious, 
media, you can read articles about this.

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:44.512
so the United States,
they know about this, about

00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:49.892
the Iran connection, about, you know,
the drug cartels, and so on and so forth.

00:37:49.892 --> 00:37:53.562
But, 
you know, now in Latin, in Latin America,

00:37:53.688 --> 00:38:00.736
because this is including Mexico,
we have, a problem that more and more

00:38:00.736 --> 00:38:06.409
the cartels are taking over politics,
and you don't need to do the revolution.

00:38:06.409 --> 00:38:08.494
And actually, this is really interesting.

00:38:08.494 --> 00:38:10.955
Chavez used to be a proponent

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:14.417
of what he called 21st century socialism.

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:16.711
That is what he used to talk about.

00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:19.714
We are doing 21st century socialism.

00:38:20.047 --> 00:38:24.719
So what did that mean after the fall,
the fall of the Berlin Wall?

00:38:25.052 --> 00:38:28.723
they came all together in, in Brazil,
you know, this whole Bible forum with

00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:29.557
and so on.

00:38:29.557 --> 00:38:32.226
And, and they said, okay,
we are going to use democracy.

00:38:32.226 --> 00:38:37.940
We are going to use democracy in order to,
create the socialist system.

00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:41.694
We are not going to fight
a Revolutionary war necessarily,

00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:45.573
but we are going to use it
in order to come to power.

00:38:45.573 --> 00:38:48.576
And then once we are there,
we established our our system.

00:38:48.784 --> 00:38:53.372
And we never leave if we can, if we can,
avoid to leave, we are going to stay.

00:38:53.372 --> 00:38:54.248
Okay.

00:38:54.248 --> 00:38:59.545
So, the cartels have been playing
an important role in this because,

00:39:00.212 --> 00:39:03.758
at some point, Chavez needed them

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:08.012
and he offered refuge
to the Colombian cartels from the,

00:39:08.304 --> 00:39:14.143
attacks that the Uribe administration,
where it was, you know, engaging in

00:39:14.393 --> 00:39:18.314
and they would come into Venezuelan
territory and Chavez would protect them.

00:39:18.731 --> 00:39:22.443
And, and and the Colombian army couldn't
go into Venezuelan territory

00:39:22.443 --> 00:39:26.530
because that would have meant
a probably war with the Venezuelan army.

00:39:26.947 --> 00:39:29.950
So they started with that.

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:35.081
And the cartels, also started
channeling money to the regime.

00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:36.791
And at some point,

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.753
the regime
itself, especially with Dark Coelho,

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:44.715
who is a very high up in the Maduro

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:48.552
administration, became, cartel boss.

00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:52.556
Now you have free agents in, in Venezuela,
but also in Mexico.

00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:56.644
In Mexico, for instance, 30% of
the Mexican territory is controlled

00:39:56.644 --> 00:39:59.647
by the cartels, 30%.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:02.650
in Venezuela you have complete

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:05.653
regions, complete states
that are being run by the cartels.

00:40:06.487 --> 00:40:07.113
Okay.

00:40:07.113 --> 00:40:10.658
And and now we have a, a country
like Chile

00:40:10.658 --> 00:40:13.661
that used to be a safe country,
like the most advanced country.

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:17.289
The cartels are taking over,
complete regions of the country.

00:40:17.873 --> 00:40:20.042
with their guns and so on.

00:40:20.042 --> 00:40:23.587
Now these cartels have, again, connections
with Hezbollah.

00:40:23.963 --> 00:40:26.257
They work, they work with them.

00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:29.260
And, and Hezbollah

00:40:29.635 --> 00:40:34.306
is creating now in, in Bolivia,
which is also a far left administration

00:40:34.306 --> 00:40:37.476
and which is a big producer of, of Coke
Bolivia.

00:40:37.852 --> 00:40:43.399
They are creating or establishing,
facilities to produce drones,

00:40:44.442 --> 00:40:47.445
that are for, for military purposes.

00:40:47.528 --> 00:40:50.531
But also we have to remember that
Bolivia and Venezuela.

00:40:51.031 --> 00:40:53.826
I know this for a fact in Venezuela,
but I think it's also true for Bolivia.

00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:56.829
They have uranium,
which is important for the Iranians,

00:40:57.204 --> 00:41:00.207
for the nuclear program
that Iran wants to develop.

00:41:00.416 --> 00:41:03.377
So the cartels have become
a source of funding.

00:41:03.377 --> 00:41:06.714
They have become the government
in the case of, Venezuela.

00:41:07.256 --> 00:41:12.511
And they don't want to lose their,
business model.

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:16.640
And that's why
I think they are not going to,

00:41:16.724 --> 00:41:20.811
accept the transition to democracy
in Venezuela, but they are destabilizing

00:41:21.103 --> 00:41:23.898
the whole of Latin America
because they are business.

00:41:23.898 --> 00:41:28.068
They are expanding everywhere
they can in order to make more profits.

00:41:28.444 --> 00:41:32.281
And a country like Chile, for instance,
which used to be like,

00:41:33.073 --> 00:41:35.618
you know, free from this problem,

00:41:35.618 --> 00:41:38.704
now has become the third
largest exporter of cocaine to Europe

00:41:39.413 --> 00:41:42.666
because we are integrated,
with the rest of the world.

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:45.169
We have many free trade agreements.

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:48.088
And so you have ships here
that go everywhere.

00:41:48.088 --> 00:41:53.302
And we have no basically no control
on the border with Peru and Bolivia.

00:41:53.552 --> 00:41:56.680
And so they bring all this cocaine
through the northern border,

00:41:56.972 --> 00:41:59.975
and then they export it via
the Chilean ports

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:03.062
to the United States,
to Europe and everywhere.

00:42:03.062 --> 00:42:07.358
And so, this is corrupting everything
in, in Latin America.

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:13.030
And I've hurt and I think this is,
this is, in the media also that the trend

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:18.202
that I wear, which is, you know,
one of these cartels and organized crime,

00:42:19.745 --> 00:42:20.871
groups are also

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:23.874
operating in New York
and other cities in the United States.

00:42:23.958 --> 00:42:25.209
of course, why not?

00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:28.629
And if it's easy to get into
the United States, it's a huge market.

00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:30.005
Why not?

00:42:30.005 --> 00:42:30.965
So this is the problem.

00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:33.968
We are we are becoming a narco region.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.928
Our our region controlled by the narcos.

00:42:35.928 --> 00:42:38.931
And, 
politicians are working for the narcos.

00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:43.477
And the problem with this is that Iran,
Russia and China don't care about this.

00:42:43.477 --> 00:42:46.897
They just used these cartels
or the connections

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:49.900
with the cartels for their own purposes.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.571
And that's why you see the first countries
recognizing Maduro's fraud,

00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:57.783
saying that he was democratically elected,
where China, Russia and Iran,

00:42:58.284 --> 00:43:01.287
these three countries.

00:43:01.954 --> 00:43:03.497
Okay. So.

00:43:03.497 --> 00:43:03.831
Okay.

00:43:03.831 --> 00:43:09.128
So let's speak to something more practical
and psychological for a moment. Or

00:43:10.129 --> 00:43:12.089
so many people

00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:15.175
who are watching
and listening will be wondering, at least

00:43:15.175 --> 00:43:18.262
in some corner of their imagination,
why the hell they should care.

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:21.765
You know,
there's lots of things that are besetting

00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:25.227
the typical American voter at the moment.

00:43:25.352 --> 00:43:28.147
The situation in the United States
is far from stable.

00:43:28.147 --> 00:43:30.065
I would say the same thing about Canada.

00:43:30.065 --> 00:43:36.071
There are many, catastrophes and looming
catastrophes to be concerned about.

00:43:36.363 --> 00:43:40.409
And what happens typically
is that anything to do

00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:43.412
with South in Central
America takes a pretty

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:44.663
well.

00:43:44.663 --> 00:43:47.124
It takes a back seat, to say the least.

00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:50.127
So, I mean, when we met in Chile,

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:54.798
you were obviously interested
in pursuing this conversation as I was.

00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:58.469
And what would you say to people
who are listening in the United States

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:00.387
and Canada,
let's say, and elsewhere in the world,

00:44:00.387 --> 00:44:04.767
about why they should care about
what's happening with regards to China

00:44:04.767 --> 00:44:09.897
and Iran and Russia in South America
and the cartels mean South America has

00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:14.902
always been a relatively unstable place
from the perspective of the northern West.

00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:19.865
And in some ways,
this is par for the par for the course.

00:44:19.907 --> 00:44:23.577
I mean, the Cold War
has been being played out

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:27.539
in a manner similar to this
for as long as I can possibly remember.

00:44:27.998 --> 00:44:28.957
In what?

00:44:28.957 --> 00:44:33.379
What is it that you want to bring
to the attention of the typical person

00:44:33.379 --> 00:44:34.046
in Canada?

00:44:34.046 --> 00:44:38.509
In the US, with regards to what's happening down south, and why should they care?

00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:41.053
the.

00:44:41.053 --> 00:44:45.349
The thing is that the United States
used to care a lot about Latin America.

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:47.643
A lot during the Cold War.

00:44:47.643 --> 00:44:48.477
They intervened.

00:44:48.477 --> 00:44:52.231
Every country in order
to prevent them from becoming communist

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:54.483
and Soviet aligned countries.

00:44:54.483 --> 00:44:59.738
Because the KGB back then had the theory
that the Cold War would be won.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:03.200
in the, in the Third World, basically,

00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:06.662
and and Henry Kissinger, for instance,

00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:10.332
when Salvador Allende in Chile
was elected in 1970,

00:45:10.499 --> 00:45:15.671
he was the first Marxist Marxist president
ever democratically elected in history.

00:45:16.004 --> 00:45:20.050
And Henry Kissinger
said, and I'm quoting him literally,

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:24.763
the, the,
the election is the greatest threat

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:28.809
that has, occur in the Western Hemisphere
in a long time

00:45:29.476 --> 00:45:32.813
because he understood that, you know,
this could have a domino effect.

00:45:32.813 --> 00:45:35.816
Other countries would follow not only in
Latin America, but also in Europe.

00:45:35.983 --> 00:45:37.526
But now you have the following problem.

00:45:39.319 --> 00:45:41.447
the United States, after September 11th,

00:45:41.447 --> 00:45:44.616
they the country completely
forgot about Latin America.

00:45:44.616 --> 00:45:46.201
We don't exist anymore.

00:45:46.201 --> 00:45:48.495
Okay. For them in terms of foreign policy.

00:45:48.495 --> 00:45:50.330
And I'm not really exaggerating.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:55.085
if if September 11th would not happen,
have happened,

00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:58.088
I think the history of Latin America
would be completely different right now.

00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:01.508
so they forgot about us, and now
they have Russia and they have China,

00:46:01.508 --> 00:46:05.179
and they have other problems that are they
look more important than Latin America.

00:46:05.637 --> 00:46:08.474
But the thing is that the main migration

00:46:08.474 --> 00:46:11.477
forwards in the United States are Latinos.

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:15.606
And if the continent continues to this
time, it to destabilize,

00:46:15.898 --> 00:46:18.692
because of narco cartels,
because of people like Maduro

00:46:18.692 --> 00:46:21.820
and so on, you will have
you will have millions more people

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.782
coming into the United States, millions.

00:46:24.823 --> 00:46:27.367
And among them you will have

00:46:27.367 --> 00:46:30.746
the Iranian Hezbollah people and
and so on and so forth.

00:46:31.205 --> 00:46:35.042
So from that point of view, it is
really important for national security.

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:39.505
and then when they are in the United
States,

00:46:39.505 --> 00:46:43.091
Latinos tend to favor
the Democratic Party.

00:46:43.509 --> 00:46:47.805
Two thirds, of Latinos, they vote
for Democrat for the Democratic Party.

00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:50.808
I think this is changing a little bit,
but not enough.

00:46:50.849 --> 00:46:56.355
so if you have, a change,
a substantial change

00:46:56.355 --> 00:47:00.192
in the demographics in the United States
and we know this is happening,

00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:06.156
this will have, political impact that is
really, really will be very substantial.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.409
Why do Latinos vote
for the Democratic Party?

00:47:09.409 --> 00:47:10.577
Because

00:47:10.577 --> 00:47:15.040
when we immigrate to the United States,
we bring our belief systems with us.

00:47:15.082 --> 00:47:18.460
It's not like because where in the US
suddenly will of Thomas Jefferson.

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:20.170
That's not how it works.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:25.092
they favor
the welfare state and government handouts.

00:47:25.092 --> 00:47:27.177
And I'm not saying everyone,
they are moderate.

00:47:27.177 --> 00:47:29.513
Most of them are very hardworking people
and so on.

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:32.391
And I mean, we cannot complain.

00:47:32.391 --> 00:47:36.520
And most people hate Maduro, for instance,
of Venezuelan who have escaped.

00:47:37.062 --> 00:47:40.983
but the point is
that if I was an American,

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:44.528
I would be worried that the,

00:47:44.653 --> 00:47:47.656
cultural landscape in my country

00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:51.869
would be changing so much because of this
migration force that is coming into

00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:56.206
the United States, that at some point
it will be politically unmanageable

00:47:56.206 --> 00:48:00.002
for someone who wants to keep your country
the way it was in terms of,

00:48:00.502 --> 00:48:04.423
you know, the idea of the institution
of limited government, so on, so,

00:48:04.423 --> 00:48:07.634
so which is when they speak
about the purple states,

00:48:07.843 --> 00:48:11.388
people moving from, from California
to Texas, for instance.

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:15.934
And they, they, they tell them, don't,
don't vote for what you left for.

00:48:15.934 --> 00:48:20.606
No. So, so but is the same with Latinos
going into the United States?

00:48:20.647 --> 00:48:22.983
it's the largest minority.

00:48:22.983 --> 00:48:27.446
And it is really important to, to,
to have a stable region.

00:48:27.446 --> 00:48:30.991
So you don't have this influx of, of, of,
of people coming into your country first,

00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:36.288
but then also, because it poses,
as I said, a risk for national security.

00:48:36.288 --> 00:48:41.501
And on top of that, geopolitically,
Latin America is extremely important

00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:46.840
in this Second World War
because supply chains are globalizing.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.843
Now, you know,
you have this trade war going on

00:48:49.843 --> 00:48:52.846
with China, and you need countries
where you have

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:56.642
you can produce your stuff,
you need raw materials.

00:48:56.892 --> 00:48:59.353
China is buying
everything in Latin America.

00:48:59.353 --> 00:49:03.732
They are buying ports in, in in Peru,
they are buying mines in Chile.

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:06.401
they are buying everything you can.

00:49:06.401 --> 00:49:10.447
Even Panama, everywhere they are,
they are buying up natural resources.

00:49:11.156 --> 00:49:14.076
And Americans are looking the other way.

00:49:14.076 --> 00:49:17.454
So I think this is not, 
this is the backyard.

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:22.292
There is a reason why you had the Monroe
Doctrine at some point in 1832.

00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:26.672
What they said, okay,
we are not intervening in Latin America,

00:49:26.672 --> 00:49:30.550
but we will not accept any foreign power
also,

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:33.011
going to Latin America
and intervening there and,

00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:36.473
you know, having this, this region
as a, as their sphere of influence.

00:49:36.765 --> 00:49:39.643
But the Monroe Doctrine
seems not to exist anymore,

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:42.604
that this is a new development.

00:49:42.729 --> 00:49:46.358
For most of its history, the United States
has really cared about Latin America

00:49:46.358 --> 00:49:50.112
because they understood how important it
was for them, for their national security

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.488
and for the national interest.

00:49:52.531 --> 00:49:54.032
Well, I think we made the

00:49:54.032 --> 00:49:57.536
great mistake in the West of assuming that

00:49:58.245 --> 00:50:01.081
because the Soviet Union collapsed,

00:50:01.081 --> 00:50:06.670
the victory over the ideology that it made
manifest

00:50:07.254 --> 00:50:10.716
was not only complete,
but in some ways self-evident.

00:50:11.925 --> 00:50:13.343
Right. Victory had been attained.

00:50:13.343 --> 00:50:14.803
The end of history, let's say.

00:50:14.803 --> 00:50:17.889
And it turns out that the spirit

00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:22.728
of envious of the envious radicals was in

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:26.898
no real way diminished by the cataclysmic,

00:50:27.733 --> 00:50:30.694
catastrophe of the Soviet Union.

00:50:30.777 --> 00:50:33.905
In fact,
to some degree quite the opposite, because

00:50:35.115 --> 00:50:37.242
when I was younger

00:50:37.242 --> 00:50:41.288
and the Soviet Union
was still in full operation,

00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:45.250
you could point to the Soviet Union
as an object lesson

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:49.588
in the dangers
of an anti-free market ideology.

00:50:50.505 --> 00:50:52.632
But now the Soviet Union has disappeared.

00:50:52.632 --> 00:50:55.677
And so it's much more difficult to

00:50:56.261 --> 00:50:58.638
to point to something
that's happening right now.

00:50:58.638 --> 00:50:59.973
Well, you could point to Venezuela,

00:50:59.973 --> 00:51:03.852
you can point to North Korea,
but they're their economies that didn't

00:51:03.852 --> 00:51:06.938
have the scale or the presence,
obviously, of the Soviet Union.

00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:11.860
And so all of this has gone
back underground that the

00:51:12.861 --> 00:51:15.280
the attractiveness of the communist

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:18.825
revolutionary ideas
hasn't seemed to diminish at all.

00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:22.079
So now your point is, okay,
so let's summarize this.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:27.542
Well, it's probably not a good idea
to distribute $1 trillion to radical

00:51:27.542 --> 00:51:32.255
leftist utopian criminal dictatorships
all over South America and the world.

00:51:32.714 --> 00:51:35.467
That seems like a bad idea
if you're trying to maintain a certain

00:51:35.467 --> 00:51:38.470
degree of stability,
even in your own country,

00:51:38.678 --> 00:51:41.932
that manifests itself
in all manner of economic collapse

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:44.017
that drives migration northward.

00:51:44.017 --> 00:51:46.603
We've seen tremendous pressure
on the American border,

00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:49.564
and by all appearances,
especially if Kamala Harris wins.

00:51:50.857 --> 00:51:52.651
however, that might play itself out.

00:51:52.651 --> 00:51:54.486
That's only going to get worse.

00:51:54.486 --> 00:51:58.782
And so the the idea that the U.S.

00:51:59.699 --> 00:52:03.703
and Canada,
by implication, can separate themselves

00:52:04.037 --> 00:52:07.499
from the geopolitical occurrences

00:52:07.499 --> 00:52:10.836
in South America is a
that's a fool's delusion.

00:52:10.836 --> 00:52:14.756
And that's especially the case
if it's Venezuela with all that oil

00:52:14.756 --> 00:52:15.674
money, let's say,

00:52:16.675 --> 00:52:19.636
and oil that the rest of the world
needs is in bed,

00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:22.681
not only with, narco cartels
who are brutal

00:52:22.681 --> 00:52:26.351
criminals beyond the comprehension
of any normal person to imagine,

00:52:26.601 --> 00:52:31.481
but also simultaneously in bed with Iran,
which is one seriously bad actor.

00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:34.901
Russia, which is basically at war
with the West, and China,

00:52:34.901 --> 00:52:35.944
which is the biggest threat

00:52:35.944 --> 00:52:39.489
to freedom that the world has ever seen
since the Soviet Union.

00:52:40.031 --> 00:52:42.868
And so that's all playing itself
out in South America

00:52:42.868 --> 00:52:45.871
and driving migration northward.

00:52:46.204 --> 00:52:47.998
And I would add, in the end.

00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:49.291
Jordan. If.

00:52:49.291 --> 00:52:52.419
If China, Iran and. And Russia.

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:56.298
Your main enemies of the western world
really care about Latin America.

00:52:56.715 --> 00:53:00.343
You should too, you know, because they are
they are here.

00:53:00.343 --> 00:53:02.929
They are.
They are involved in these countries.

00:53:02.929 --> 00:53:05.807
They are investing tons of money
at least the Chinese,

00:53:05.807 --> 00:53:08.101
Russia is sending executives.

00:53:08.101 --> 00:53:11.104
Even the Wagner Group
has been seen in Venezuela.

00:53:11.271 --> 00:53:16.359
they they know that they need strongholds
close to the United States,

00:53:16.735 --> 00:53:19.738
and they want to destabilize the region,
because they also know

00:53:19.738 --> 00:53:22.282
that this destabilizes the United States.

00:53:22.282 --> 00:53:28.079
And so,
I mean, it's this so obvious, but,

00:53:28.997 --> 00:53:29.873
I don't know,

00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:34.961
I even in the conservative movement
in, in the US, this is not understood.

00:53:34.961 --> 00:53:37.964
I think someone like Marco
Rubio understands this very well.

00:53:38.423 --> 00:53:41.760
or maybe Ted Cruz, but I think the,

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.055
traditional Republican politicians
are they don't understand this.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.726
They they don't see how how
big of a threat of a threat

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:53.647
we can become if China and Russia
and Iran, they take over these countries.

00:53:53.647 --> 00:53:57.734
And by the way, we have, 
some of the largest reserves in natural

00:53:57.734 --> 00:54:03.782
gas in the world, copper, 
lithium, silver,

00:54:04.282 --> 00:54:08.495
gold, whatever oil, all these things
you have here

00:54:08.787 --> 00:54:12.165
in manufacturing capacity
in Latin America is also very strong.

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:15.502
so and you will need that at some point.

00:54:15.502 --> 00:54:18.755
And we are relatively
young population still in Latin America

00:54:19.673 --> 00:54:22.425
as compared to Europe
or even the United States or Canada.

00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:25.428
We are growing old, very rapidly.

00:54:25.512 --> 00:54:28.515
So for all of these reasons,
I think it's not a smart

00:54:28.515 --> 00:54:31.685
move to to just ignore
what's going on in your backyard.

00:54:31.726 --> 00:54:32.060
It's never

00:54:34.229 --> 00:54:35.772
Starting a business can be tough,

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:39.693

00:55:43.131 --> 00:55:44.007
Well that was certainly

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:47.177
my sense when I toured
through South America for that.

00:55:47.218 --> 00:55:50.430
For what that's worth
I mean it you know it's.

00:55:52.932 --> 00:55:55.852
It's obvious that what's playing out
there needs to be attended to.

00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:56.102
Okay.

00:55:56.102 --> 00:55:59.147
So let's, let's flip back to Venezuela
specifically for a moment.

00:55:59.147 --> 00:56:04.069
So could you give us an account,
for example, of what ordinary

00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:08.073
life is like for a Venezuelan,
for the typical Venezuelan citizen?

00:56:08.073 --> 00:56:11.993
Now, you said that 25% of the population
has decided

00:56:11.993 --> 00:56:15.372
to vote with their feet,
and that's an awful lot of people.

00:56:15.663 --> 00:56:18.958
And that you said that, you know,
the GDP is collapsed

00:56:18.958 --> 00:56:21.961
by 70%, oil production is down 80%.

00:56:21.961 --> 00:56:26.883
And, and that 80% of the population
lives in poverty.

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:29.886
And so what is what is the typical

00:56:30.011 --> 00:56:33.973
what what is typical reality
for a Venezuelan citizen now?

00:56:33.973 --> 00:56:36.434
Because we never hear
about it, we have no idea.

00:56:38.103 --> 00:56:40.021
would expect in a socialist Paradise.

00:56:40.021 --> 00:56:43.149
It's basically is
you don't have enough food to eat.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:47.570
Calorie intake in Venezuela
has collapsed over the last 15 years.

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:48.655
20 years?

00:56:48.655 --> 00:56:51.282
you don't have medicines,

00:56:51.282 --> 00:56:54.953
you don't have, hospitals
that are functioning,

00:56:55.495 --> 00:56:58.748
you have no grid, electric, electricity.

00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:00.166
You have problems all the time.

00:57:00.166 --> 00:57:02.502
in Caracas, everywhere in a country
that is very hot,

00:57:02.502 --> 00:57:04.379
many regions of Venezuela are very hot.

00:57:04.379 --> 00:57:06.756
You don't have air conditioning
or any of that.

00:57:06.756 --> 00:57:10.635
and only people
who can get access to dollars because.

00:57:10.635 --> 00:57:13.638
Because you are there are remittances
going to to the country.

00:57:14.055 --> 00:57:16.975
They they manage to survive.

00:57:16.975 --> 00:57:22.147
but this is the reason why, almost
a quarter of the population I have left.

00:57:22.147 --> 00:57:26.359
And if Maduro is reinstalled in January,
you will have another couple of million

00:57:26.359 --> 00:57:27.193
living Venezuela.

00:57:27.193 --> 00:57:30.655
By the way, this is going to happen,
and we are expecting that all over

00:57:30.655 --> 00:57:31.614
Latin America.

00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:35.326
you have, 
no rule of law, civil rule of law.

00:57:35.326 --> 00:57:39.789
So you basically have a regime
that controls the judiciary,

00:57:39.873 --> 00:57:44.169
the legislative, everything, the police,
any day someone can knock at your door

00:57:44.169 --> 00:57:47.088
and to take you, a prisoner,
and you disappear

00:57:47.088 --> 00:57:49.174
and no one knows
anything about you anymore.

00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:51.759
you have to be.

00:57:51.759 --> 00:57:55.555
If you are in the opposition, you have to
be hiding and and and very careful.

00:57:55.555 --> 00:57:58.266
Even I I'm on a blacklist, I was told.

00:57:58.266 --> 00:57:59.517
And that's one of the reasons

00:57:59.517 --> 00:58:02.854
why I've never been back to Venezuela
since last time I was there, 2014,

00:58:03.354 --> 00:58:05.940
even if I'm not really relevant
within the country,

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:07.233
but because I have argued against

00:58:07.233 --> 00:58:10.904
the Maduro regime in different media
all over the the West probably

00:58:11.529 --> 00:58:14.532
at least in the United States,
in Latin America and Spain.

00:58:14.782 --> 00:58:16.117
I'm not welcome.

00:58:16.117 --> 00:58:20.705
So so imagine people who are living there,
my friends are hiding from the regime.

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:25.251
you have, many families

00:58:25.251 --> 00:58:28.254
that have been torn apart,
completely destroyed

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:31.841
because, you know,
let me tell you a also an anecdote to,

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:34.135
that is really interesting
for the audience.

00:58:34.135 --> 00:58:38.598
I was once in Miami and I took an Uber
and I started talking to the driver,

00:58:38.598 --> 00:58:44.020
and I thought that he was very,
well-educated and really intellectual,

00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:48.399
like, more than the normal.

00:58:48.399 --> 00:58:50.860
he knew a lot about law, for instance.

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.821
And I said, what what do you
what did you do in back in Venezuela?

00:58:53.821 --> 00:58:56.741
I was a minister of the Supreme Court
in Venezuela,

00:58:56.741 --> 00:58:59.744
a member of the Supreme Court
of Justice in Venezuela.

00:58:59.744 --> 00:59:02.497
And now I am your Uber driver.

00:59:02.497 --> 00:59:05.833
So this is a reality of millions

00:59:05.833 --> 00:59:09.671
of Venezuelans, you know, not only,

00:59:10.171 --> 00:59:15.260
poor people or middle class people,
but also people who are very successful.

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.345
So they had their jobs,

00:59:17.345 --> 00:59:19.973
they had their companies,
and they lost everything.

00:59:19.973 --> 00:59:21.724
They lost their families,
they lost everything.

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:26.020
And many of them have families, members
that have been killed by the regime also.

00:59:26.437 --> 00:59:29.023
So, and,

00:59:29.023 --> 00:59:33.194
and so the situation is so desperate
that I think Venezuelans

00:59:33.194 --> 00:59:37.115
are going to fight to the last breath
in order to make change possible.

00:59:37.115 --> 00:59:37.824
And Maria Corina.

00:59:37.824 --> 00:59:40.994
Marcelo, by the way,
I said this the five days until the end.

00:59:41.995 --> 00:59:42.704
And so I don't

00:59:42.704 --> 00:59:45.707
know how this is going to look like.

00:59:46.541 --> 00:59:49.544
But if if the Biden administration
does not,

00:59:50.169 --> 00:59:53.756
convince Maduro and the regime to,

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:57.260
transition back to democracy,

00:59:57.719 --> 01:00:02.265
you will maybe have a bloodbath
even worse than the one you have now.

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:07.186
By the way,
I point that this important, Chavez,

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:11.357
when he was in government,
he disarmed the Venezuelan population.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:15.278
He banned guns
for every citizen in Venezuela.

01:00:16.195 --> 01:00:20.658
The only people who could have guns
where he's his tax, basically.

01:00:20.658 --> 01:00:21.951
And this is very early on.

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:24.787
Bolivar knows the parallel armed groups
that they have.

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:28.333
funded and and they were

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:29.959
financing.

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:33.004
And so now you have a situation
where Venezuelans don't

01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:37.759
have even a pistol to defend themselves
from these hordes of,

01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:40.511
of assassins that their regime

01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:43.514
is sending to kill them
or to imprison them.

01:00:43.681 --> 01:00:46.684
And they have over 2000 people in
the last weeks have been imprisoned,

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:50.188
mostly
young people who want a better future.

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:52.982
So this is what Venezuela looks like
right now.

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:55.985
It's it's it's hell on Earth.

01:00:56.527 --> 01:00:59.906
Let's talk about the structure
of the opposition.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:03.034
So it's Maria Corina machado.

01:01:03.034 --> 01:01:06.037
I'm butchering that name, obviously.

01:01:06.287 --> 01:01:09.999
And it's difficult
from the outside to understand because.

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:14.379
Tell me how the last election,
who was put forward

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:17.882
as opposition in the last election,
what role does she play?

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:22.220
What threat does she currently face
and what well, what

01:01:22.428 --> 01:01:26.891
what can people from the outside
do to shed light on this and to help?

01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:33.564
Goretti, Marcelo, has been, the main
opposition leader for over a decade.

01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:35.233
I would say even a decade and a half.

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:40.113
Even if at some point in 2013,
for instance, after Chavez

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:43.783
died, you had an election
where Enrique Capriles,

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:47.286
lost by a small margin to Maduro.

01:01:47.286 --> 01:01:48.788
But Maduro stole that election.

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:50.248
They stole millions of votes.

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:52.959
This is not the first time
that this happens.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:57.755
and so and the reason is
because the system in Venezuela,

01:01:58.297 --> 01:02:03.010
it requires that you have,
a sort of an ID and you go and vote,

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:06.931
but the system is not integrated.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.016
So in the sense,

01:02:09.016 --> 01:02:12.520
you can with, with different IDs,
you can vote in different parts.

01:02:12.937 --> 01:02:16.816
So one member of the of the government
got like, let's say 100 IDs

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:19.861
and he could go to 100 different places
and vote for the same candidate.

01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:23.448
And this is the way they stole
the last election to 2013.

01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:28.327
and back
then, population wanted to rebel,

01:02:28.953 --> 01:02:31.748
but, Capriles said, no, let's stay home.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.416
We got we have nothing to do here.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:36.419
And so it gave, oxygen to the regime.

01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:41.340
and Maria
Corina has always been the voice of,

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:45.970
I think, reason and courage
because she was willing to fight.

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:49.891
But the opposition was very fragmented
and has been for a long time.

01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:53.436
This is the first time that they are
all together, together against the regime.

01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:56.397
so which is, which is very good.

01:02:56.397 --> 01:03:01.360
And, and she has become
the undisputed leader of the opposition,

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.155
even though with of the Gonzalez is
the press is a candidate

01:03:04.155 --> 01:03:06.282
and the president
the person elect is Eduardo Gonzalez.

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:07.325
But why?

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:11.287
Because Maduro banned
Maria Corina from running as president.

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:13.539
So. And

01:03:13.539 --> 01:03:17.376
they have been doing this forever
in Venezuela since Chavez came to power.

01:03:17.376 --> 01:03:20.379
So, so Maria Corina endorsed

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:24.383
Gonzalez to the election and Gonzalez,
no one

01:03:24.383 --> 01:03:27.804
we all know for, with a distance of over 
30 points.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:31.599
So, with a difference
of over the 30 points.

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:34.602
So, so now the opposition, at least

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:37.897
they are all together against the,
the regime.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:42.068
but the main, the main face of the
opposition is Maria Correa Marcelo, which,

01:03:42.693 --> 01:03:47.532
by the way, deserves a Nobel Prize
for peace because she, she has been

01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:52.495
so courageous and trying to, to, 
bring democratic change to Venezuela.

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:55.456
But she's not going to get it
because she is not left out leftist.

01:03:55.456 --> 01:03:58.125
So I think there is not a big hope
that she would get this.

01:03:58.125 --> 01:04:01.337
But, she faces
now the possibility of being imprisoned

01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:03.339
and who knows, maybe being killed

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:07.510
and she's
willing to give her life for the cause.

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:11.931
I mean, she's not going to turn herself
over to the regime, justice.

01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:15.601
you know, I mean, like, 
and I think that she will try to,

01:04:16.477 --> 01:04:19.480
to prevent them from, capturing her,

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.567
but she could be imprisoned
and maybe killed.

01:04:23.234 --> 01:04:26.153
so this is what she's facing.

01:04:26.153 --> 01:04:29.156
Maria Corina So she had

01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:33.995
she had Eduardo Gonzalez run in her stead.

01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:34.912
In essence.

01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:37.915
Is she in hiding at the moment.

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:53.509
So tell me about Maria Karina.

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:54.927
So why is she.

01:06:54.927 --> 01:06:58.806
What is it about her
that's made her a popular figure?

01:06:58.806 --> 01:07:00.808
I'd like to know some more about her
background.

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:04.103
And also, you know why she doesn't?

01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:06.313
Why she doesn't quit.

01:07:06.313 --> 01:07:06.814
Now, you.

01:07:06.814 --> 01:07:10.484
You explained, at least to some degree,
why she's still alive.

01:07:10.484 --> 01:07:14.613
You believe that it would be a scandal
of such preposterous magnitude

01:07:14.613 --> 01:07:19.535
if there was something that happened
to her, that the Maduro regime is afraid

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:22.830
that would turn international attention
on them

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:26.000
with sufficient drama

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.712
to actually be a threat to the continued
stability of their regime.

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:32.715
So she's protected in so far
as that's the case.

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:34.592
but what?

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:36.635
Tell me about who she is.

01:07:36.635 --> 01:07:41.265
You know, you mentioned yourself earlier
in this podcast that she's being tarred

01:07:41.265 --> 01:07:43.559
and feathered like anybody
who isn't a communist,

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:46.604
for being far right now,
because that's happening everywhere.

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:49.982
And so but again, you know, people

01:07:50.691 --> 01:07:53.736
the the far right
epithet is a very effective one.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.573
And it doesn't take much agitation,
especially

01:07:57.573 --> 01:08:01.619
from the mainstream press,
in order to make that accusation stick.

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:05.790
And so it's clear that to the degree
that you're trustworthy,

01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:08.959
you trust Maria Karina.

01:08:08.959 --> 01:08:12.213
Tell us about her so that people
have some sense of who it is

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:16.008
that is standing in opposition to Maduro.

01:08:18.052 --> 01:08:21.055
that she's the most courageous women.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.433
I think these maybe many people
will think this is an overstatement,

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:25.518
but I think this is.

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:30.189
She's the most courageous
women in politics right now in the world.

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:34.652
I cannot imagine someone
with more courage in her than hers.

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:37.363
I mean, this is I mean, she's

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:41.534
unbelievably courageous, and charismatic.

01:08:42.159 --> 01:08:45.037
And so she has this force.

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:47.206
So she's like a force of nature.

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:50.042
And this is why the regime
is so afraid of her.

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:54.088
and and she has managed
to bring the whole opposition together

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:58.384
and to create a movement of such magnitude

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:01.846
in Venezuela that even the dictatorship
with all the guns and so on.

01:09:02.221 --> 01:09:07.518
is shaking because they are
they are afraid that this is going to

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.938
in the end, you know,

01:09:10.938 --> 01:09:15.609
bring change in Venezuela and, and,
and her charisma is so powerful

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:19.864
that even members of the armed forces,
have backed her.

01:09:19.864 --> 01:09:23.075
That's, by the way,
one of the reasons why they had the access

01:09:23.075 --> 01:09:27.830
to the documents
showing that they won the presidency,

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:33.169
because members in the military were
leaking these documents to the opposition,

01:09:33.794 --> 01:09:37.506
and they have imprisoned over
100, 100 soldiers are in prison,

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.258
and they humiliate them
and they tortured them

01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:43.387
and so on, because they are behind
Maria Corina and not behind Maduro.

01:09:45.222 --> 01:09:50.269
so, but she is in favor of free markets,

01:09:51.228 --> 01:09:54.231
which is not the case
with most of the opposition in Venezuela.

01:09:54.648 --> 01:09:57.484
People might remember Leopoldo Lopez, who

01:09:57.484 --> 01:10:01.280
who was in prison for a long time,
and it was a scandal all over the world.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:06.869
I believe he's now in Spain,
but I once gave a speech with Leopoldo

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:10.873
Lopez, father in European Parliament,
and Leopoldo Lopez

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:15.085
father was defending socialism,
which was to me, it was incredible.

01:10:15.252 --> 01:10:18.881
He was saying, no, socialism does not do
what Chavez has done or what.

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:22.635
And and it's exactly
the opposite is the case.

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:25.679
And he was very nice,
when it came to this and Enrique Capriles

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:30.434
the same thing,
the last opposition leader, before

01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:34.730
White Door and Ricky Capriles,
who lost in 2013, the other day, tweeted

01:10:35.856 --> 01:10:37.149
along these lines like Chavez

01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:40.694
was the good guy and Maduro
is the bad guy, which is a narrative

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:44.073
that the left is trying to create

01:10:44.448 --> 01:10:47.117
in order to save the socialist revolution

01:10:47.117 --> 01:10:50.579
in Venezuela is the same narrative
they did with Lenin and Stalin.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.124
Oh, Lenin was a good guy,
but Stalin was a criminal.

01:10:54.124 --> 01:10:57.127
A Stalin was a, you know,

01:10:57.127 --> 01:10:59.713
coming from the proletarian
who didn't know anything.

01:10:59.713 --> 01:11:01.090
And he was he was a criminal.

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:04.385
They are doing the same
with Chavez. Maduro.

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:07.638
And to me,
it was shocking that someone like April,

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.849
who is in the opposition
and who wants regime change, would fall

01:11:10.849 --> 01:11:13.852
for this crap and this trap.

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:17.147
so Maria
Corina has never conceded anything.

01:11:17.564 --> 01:11:19.650
She has always been very coherent.

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:22.528
She believes in liberal democracy,

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:25.656
in the rule of law and the free market.

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:29.326
I guess that qualifies you
as a far right nowadays. So

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:31.870
it doesn't happen only to her.

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:32.204
I guess.

01:11:32.204 --> 01:11:35.791
But, it is really appalling that

01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:40.713
we read this sort of nonsense from,
the established media.

01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:44.049
there isn't no one more Democratic.

01:11:44.049 --> 01:11:44.925
She has.

01:11:44.925 --> 01:11:48.887
She hasn't called for a rebellion
against the government

01:11:48.887 --> 01:11:53.267
to a violent march towards Miraflores
Palace to depose Maduro.

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:55.394
She hasn't done any of that.

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:57.271
She never did that.

01:11:57.271 --> 01:11:58.939
It's just peaceful protest.

01:11:58.939 --> 01:12:00.190
That's why I'm saying she should.

01:12:00.190 --> 01:12:03.152
She should get the Nobel Peace Prize.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.446
really?

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:08.449
Because she's risking your life
for millions of Venezuelans.

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:10.576
And so you will never.

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:13.579
And I hope you you meet her one day
because you will never met a woman

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:18.292
with more, you know, not only courage,
but also integrity.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:20.419
Thinks she do a podcast.

01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:26.175
Well let's see if we can

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:37.353
make that happen. Yes.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.823
You mean like the UK?

01:16:12.442 --> 01:16:13.443
I'm wondering.

01:16:13.443 --> 01:16:16.822
Let me step sideways for a moment and

01:16:17.155 --> 01:16:19.825
and and then we'll return
to our discussion

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:22.828
about Venezuela and South America
in general.

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:26.832
You know,
I don't think it's really appropriate

01:16:27.165 --> 01:16:30.168
now to conceptualize what's happening

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:33.922
around the world, but particularly
in the West in political terms,

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:37.342
precisely because it's something deeper
than what's merely political.

01:16:37.342 --> 01:16:40.345
And one of the ideas
I've been toying with,

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:43.473
I'd like your opinion about it, is that

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:45.350
the default human

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:48.312
moral stance is probably left wing.

01:16:48.353 --> 01:16:52.399
You know, Ben Shapiro said something to me
at one point, just off the cuff that

01:16:53.358 --> 01:16:55.611
tangled its way into my thinking,
and I suppose,

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:58.572
is one of the motivations
for this idea that

01:17:00.407 --> 01:17:03.410
he said he's a communist in his family.

01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:05.954
And so, you know, if you

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:08.957
if you have a family,
if you have children,

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:12.127
you're really hoping for something like

01:17:12.377 --> 01:17:15.130
at least a part of you is hoping,
especially when they're kids,

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:17.841
for something like equality of outcome.

01:17:17.841 --> 01:17:21.011
You want everyone to do well,
you're willing to intervene

01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:24.014
on the side of the person who's,

01:17:24.097 --> 01:17:27.017
you know, bearing

01:17:27.017 --> 01:17:30.103
what, who's not quite as successful
at any given moment.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:33.690
You want to distribute resources
as equitably as possible.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:37.486
You your interaction with your children

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:41.114
and your wife is based
on essentially an ethos of care.

01:17:41.948 --> 01:17:45.952
But, you know,
if you look at organizations

01:17:45.952 --> 01:17:49.748
that move beyond the scope of the family
in size,

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:56.254
that ethos of care and equitable
care, let's say, doesn't scale well.

01:17:57.255 --> 01:18:00.676
And modern civilizations are not families.

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:05.180
And here's here's some proof of that
from the psychological perspective.

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:08.934
So the personality trait agreeableness

01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:12.062
is associated with maternal care.

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:17.484
Let's say it's it's the dimension
of empathic, self-sacrificial care.

01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:19.903
And women are substantially higher

01:18:19.903 --> 01:18:22.906
in trait agreeableness
across the world than men.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:25.909
What predicts success

01:18:25.909 --> 01:18:29.746
in a complex society on the personality
side isn't agreeableness.

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:33.500
In fact, managers
who are more agreeable do worse

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:36.378
because people take advantage of them.

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:40.507
What predicts
success on the personality side

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:43.635
in a large scale
society is conscientiousness,

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.722
and conscientiousness is due to fullness

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:49.725
and industriousness and orderliness.

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:53.270
And it's it's the ethos of hard work.

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:57.441
It's a meritocratic ethos,
and it's called virtue.

01:18:57.441 --> 01:19:00.527
Like to be conscientious isn't the same as

01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:03.530
to be emotionally caring.

01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:07.033
And so I wonder if
part of the reason that the

01:19:08.034 --> 01:19:11.788
politics of the left, so to speak,
constantly mutate

01:19:11.788 --> 01:19:15.041
and transform their immune to

01:19:16.501 --> 01:19:18.336
criticism, say

01:19:18.336 --> 01:19:22.257
by reference to history,
you can't just say, well, every communist

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:26.386
regime in the 20th century was a brutal,
bloody, dictatorial disaster.

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:29.473
It it doesn't hold water.

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:32.768
Maybe it doesn't hold water
because it's actually extremely difficult

01:19:33.226 --> 01:19:39.441
to socialize people so that they can take
their place in a complex society

01:19:39.691 --> 01:19:42.652
without defaulting to the underlying

01:19:42.652 --> 01:19:45.989
ethos of familial care, you know?

01:19:45.989 --> 01:19:48.575
And so if you're a harsh
and discriminating person,

01:19:48.575 --> 01:19:52.329
if you're very meritocratic oriented,
if you say to someone,

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:55.999
I don't give a damn about your feelings,
it matters what sort of job you do.

01:19:56.625 --> 01:20:01.338
You know, you're you're a harsh voice,
and you might be a necessary voice

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:05.300
to keep civilization itself running,
but that doesn't mean

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:08.386
that you're necessarily
an attractive voice, especially to people

01:20:08.386 --> 01:20:11.389
who think instinctively
in terms of an ethos of care.

01:20:11.723 --> 01:20:14.559
And it's very,
very easy to appeal to that.

01:20:14.559 --> 01:20:16.061
And so I think part of the problem

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:19.064
and then you might add to that,
another problem.

01:20:19.105 --> 01:20:20.190
So imagine that

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:22.818
if you're driven by

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:27.906
necessity, when times are hard,
it becomes obvious that those

01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:32.744
who can should be allowed to do
or should be pushed forward.

01:20:32.744 --> 01:20:33.286
To do that,

01:20:33.286 --> 01:20:37.332
the meritocratic have to rise to the top
because otherwise disaster looms.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:41.503
If you've been in a situation
where economic security has been granted

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:46.550
to you in some ways
effortlessly for several generations,

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:51.471
even it it's also perhaps much easier
to default to that ethos of care

01:20:51.471 --> 01:20:57.227
and to attend to the outliers in society
who haven't served themselves well,

01:20:57.227 --> 01:21:02.023
but also perhaps haven't been served
well by the conscientious ethos.

01:21:02.482 --> 01:21:04.317
And so I'm wondering
about your thoughts of that,

01:21:04.317 --> 01:21:06.736
you know, like
because we usually think about this.

01:21:06.736 --> 01:21:10.866
Well, some people have left wing beliefs
and some people have right wing beliefs,

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.075
and that's the battlefield.

01:21:12.075 --> 01:21:13.034
It's like,

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:14.160
I don't think that's a good

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.706
level of analysis, because I don't exactly
think this is about ideas.

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:23.169
I think the default human position
might be equality of outcome

01:21:23.169 --> 01:21:24.462
in small groups,

01:21:24.462 --> 01:21:28.842
and that you have to struggle against that
mightily with your education system,

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:33.513
maybe your moral system as a whole,
to impose a meritocratic

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:37.309
like a cold virtue meritocracy
on top of that.

01:21:37.642 --> 01:21:41.021
And what obviously, we haven't been doing
a very good job of that.

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:45.400
So I'm curious, you're well-versed
in the Austrian school of economics.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.403
I'm I'm wondering what you think
of that kind of theorizing.

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:52.240
And this is really interesting,
because Friedrich Hayek

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:55.744
wrote a paper
called The Mirage of Social Justice,

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:58.622
where he argued
exactly what you are saying.

01:21:58.622 --> 01:22:03.460
He said that this idea of social justice,
that justice that we had to,

01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:08.882
you know, redistribute wealth
so everyone gets an equal share

01:22:09.215 --> 01:22:11.927
or in terms that, guarantee

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:14.930
the survival of the, community.

01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:18.016
it's an idea that he attributes

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:23.521
to our past for thousands of years,
we were a small communities,

01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:26.608
tribes, basically, we have this family

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:29.819
ethos, the care ethos,
and it was the way to survive.

01:22:29.819 --> 01:22:32.906
But we were communities
only of a couple of, dozen

01:22:32.906 --> 01:22:35.951
people, or maybe over 100,
but not more than that.

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:38.328
You knew everyone.

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:40.705
and and this is the instincts.

01:22:40.705 --> 01:22:46.503
He says we evolved, in this,
type of environment.

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:50.882
And and so socialism, in the end,
wants to apply,

01:22:51.174 --> 01:22:56.638
this moral instincts
to the what he called the complex

01:22:56.638 --> 01:23:00.725
society, the larger society, you know,
which is civilization, basically.

01:23:01.017 --> 01:23:05.605
And that's why, 
you have this regression towards tribalism

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:10.235
and you have it with, with socialism
and communism and with nationalism,

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:14.239
when nationalism is exacerbated,
like the Nazis did in Germany, then you

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.283
you go back to the tribe
and you feel protected by the tribe, and,

01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:21.621
and you have this unifying, 
referee against this identity.

01:23:21.621 --> 01:23:24.207
And you are,
you know, like you are, again,

01:23:24.207 --> 01:23:26.793
like this organism
and you are part of a whole.

01:23:26.793 --> 01:23:29.129
You are not just an individual
looking for yourself.

01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:33.049
And this is the care ethics
ethos that you were, talking about

01:23:33.049 --> 01:23:35.010
is really interesting
also because Gerald Coyne,

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:39.347
who was a very famous Marxist,
a professor at Oxford University, he said,

01:23:39.597 --> 01:23:42.892
he wrote a book, why not socialism?

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:47.605
and by socialism he didn't mean Nordic
type of welfare state

01:23:47.605 --> 01:23:49.858
or something like that.
He meant like really?

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:52.110
So equality of outcomes more or less.

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:55.113
and he was saying and he said that the,

01:23:55.196 --> 01:24:00.035
instinctive socialist
ideology of the socialist philosophy

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:04.497
appealed to an end, an instinct
that was so ingrained in human nature.

01:24:04.914 --> 01:24:09.127
And it was going to come back over
and over and over Yeah.

01:24:09.252 --> 01:24:09.461
Yeah.

01:24:13.673 --> 01:24:16.092
Okay.

01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:16.509
okay.

01:24:16.509 --> 01:24:18.428
Let me add two data points to that.

01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:19.679
Okay. Or three.

01:24:19.679 --> 01:24:24.309
So we did a study in 2016
looking at personality

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:27.604
and cognitive predictors
of politically correct authoritarianism.

01:24:27.812 --> 01:24:29.856
So that wouldn't be democratic socialism.

01:24:29.856 --> 01:24:32.859
That would be the far left
authoritarian types.

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:35.445
And the things that predicted it were low

01:24:35.445 --> 01:24:38.448
verbal intelligence,
which was a walloping predictor.

01:24:38.615 --> 01:24:41.284
So you could imagine
it's a very simple narrative, right?

01:24:41.284 --> 01:24:43.536
There are victims
and there are victimizers.

01:24:43.536 --> 01:24:44.954
That explains everything.

01:24:44.954 --> 01:24:47.248
And if you're moral,
you're on the side of the victims.

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:52.170
And that's that's something
like a predatory infant instinct.

01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:52.712
Right?

01:24:52.712 --> 01:24:55.215
There are predators there are infants.

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:58.802
You're obviously on the side of the
infants, and to hell with the predators.

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:02.806
So so you can think of that
as an instinctual orientation

01:25:02.806 --> 01:25:05.433
and an effective
one under certain conditions. Okay.

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:07.519
What else predicted?

01:25:08.561 --> 01:25:10.730
feminine temperament,

01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:13.733
high agreeableness in particular.

01:25:13.733 --> 01:25:15.485
And then.

01:25:15.485 --> 01:25:17.946
And then there's another
the other data point I would say

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:22.659
is that if you look in the United States
right now, the the people who are holding

01:25:22.659 --> 01:25:25.662
the radical utopians in power

01:25:25.912 --> 01:25:28.915
are women between 18 and 34.

01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:29.916
Okay.

01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:34.379
And now they're particularly targeted
by the Iranians and the Chinese

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:37.340
on TikTok. Right.

01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:41.344
And they're bombarded with images, for
example, of dying Palestinian children.

01:25:42.345 --> 01:25:44.556
And that's a targeted attack.
We know that.

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:45.890
We know that the Iranians

01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:48.893
are behind that in the Chinese,
and it's extremely effective.

01:25:48.893 --> 01:25:53.398
And women between the ages of 18
and 34 are wildly discordant

01:25:53.398 --> 01:25:56.734
in their political views
in relationship to everyone else.

01:25:57.152 --> 01:26:00.613
Now, 50% of them are also childless.

01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:02.073
Right.

01:26:02.073 --> 01:26:06.119
So so there's an element
of the maternal instinct run amok

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:08.872
on the political landscape,
because you could easily say,

01:26:08.872 --> 01:26:11.124
and I don't think
that it's an exaggeration

01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:14.586
and our empirical data
is supported that is that,

01:26:16.087 --> 01:26:17.005
that maternal

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:20.008
instinct is going to find its target.

01:26:20.341 --> 01:26:22.760
It's, it's going to find its expression.

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:26.681
And if it doesn't find its expression
within the confines of a family

01:26:27.265 --> 01:26:30.268
where there's some real demand
to take care of the,

01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:34.355
of those who are unable
to take care of themselves, children,

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:38.818
essentially infants primarily, then it's
going to find its expression politically.

01:26:38.818 --> 01:26:39.986
And that can be exploited,

01:26:39.986 --> 01:26:43.740
as it certainly is, by the Chinese
and the Iranians on TikTok.

01:26:44.073 --> 01:26:45.074
And so.

01:26:45.074 --> 01:26:48.494
The battle
that we're engaged in politically,

01:26:48.494 --> 01:26:52.207
I believe, is better construed
and in the manner that we just described.

01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:57.503
It's a it's a battle between
an instinctive orientation towards care

01:26:58.046 --> 01:27:01.716
and a higher order
cognitive interpretation

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:07.305
that's associated with conscientiousness
that notes how complex system of systems

01:27:07.305 --> 01:27:11.100
operate and introduces a different
standard, which would essentially be

01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:14.979
something like the the cold hearted,
meritocratic standard.

01:27:15.605 --> 01:27:16.856
Okay. So you see that.

01:27:16.856 --> 01:27:21.736
You see a parallel between that and what
the Austrian school economists proposed.

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:24.656
Okay. That's that's
what I, that's what I thought.

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:26.157
So okay. Okay.

01:27:26.157 --> 01:27:26.491
Okay.

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:29.577
So that's that I'm going to bang
that around in the back of my head.

01:27:29.786 --> 01:27:31.454
Maybe we could turn.

01:27:31.454 --> 01:27:35.583
We don't have a lot of time for this
because we're running out of time

01:27:35.583 --> 01:27:36.459
on the YouTube side.

01:27:36.459 --> 01:27:39.796
But maybe we could turn our attention to

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:43.216
developments
that are arguably somewhat positive.

01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:45.385
Chile is somewhat positive.

01:27:45.385 --> 01:27:48.554
What do you think about what's happening
in Argentina with Malaya?

01:27:48.554 --> 01:27:54.352
And we also have the example
of El Salvador under and with its turning

01:27:54.352 --> 01:27:57.814
to both Bitcoin, interestingly enough,
and to the US dollar.

01:27:58.231 --> 01:27:59.524
So I'm

01:28:00.858 --> 01:28:03.069
what let's start with Argentina.

01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:07.240
So what are your views on
what is what is happening in Argentina

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.325
like is what Malaya is doing is that

01:28:09.325 --> 01:28:13.496
is that being is that producing
any success on economic grounds?

01:28:13.496 --> 01:28:16.499
Because it's very difficult
to sort out the wheat from the chaff

01:28:16.582 --> 01:28:19.419
in terms of anything
approximating legacy media

01:28:19.419 --> 01:28:22.422
coverage of Argentina.

01:28:23.214 --> 01:28:26.926
here that I'm a good friend of Millay,
and we have been working

01:28:26.926 --> 01:28:29.929
for, cost of freedom in Latin America
for ten years.

01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:32.890
together.

01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:36.644
So what is happening in Argentina
is the most fascinating

01:28:36.644 --> 01:28:39.814
and interesting thing
that I've seen, of course, in my lifetime,

01:28:39.814 --> 01:28:43.776
but also, I think in the last, 
half a century, because

01:28:44.902 --> 01:28:47.905
what, what is really taking
place is a cultural revolution.

01:28:48.406 --> 01:28:52.118
And in a positive sense,
not the not the Chinese type of Ma

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:58.082
Maoist type of cultural revolution,
but Argentina was the wealthiest country

01:28:58.082 --> 01:29:02.712
in the world in 18 96, with the highest
per capita income in the world.

01:29:02.712 --> 01:29:04.964
We had a constitution in place.

01:29:04.964 --> 01:29:09.761
The 1853 constitution that was designed
by Juan Bautista Alberti,

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:13.222
who was an admirer of the founding Fathers
of the United States.

01:29:13.222 --> 01:29:16.225
He was a classical liberal, conservative,
classical liberal.

01:29:16.392 --> 01:29:19.937
He believed that the government
had to be limited, and he

01:29:19.937 --> 01:29:24.025
he saw in the French revolutionary
tradition of people like John Jackson

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:27.820
saw one of the main reasons why

01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:30.907
Latin America was not prosperous enough,

01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:35.411
and because we expect expected everything
from omnipotent government.

01:29:35.453 --> 01:29:39.624
He actually has an article called
openly Put in government and he said

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:42.794
the Americans, on the other hand,
they they expect from government nothing.

01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:45.171
They fix these things for themselves.
Okay.

01:29:45.171 --> 01:29:48.132
So he created the 1853 Constitution,

01:29:48.966 --> 01:29:51.886
and after that, Argentina became

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:54.889
the most successful country in the world
in terms of per capita.

01:29:55.181 --> 01:29:58.184
in combat, if you went to 1914,

01:29:58.518 --> 01:30:01.771
you had half of the population in Buenos
Aires was born,

01:30:01.771 --> 01:30:04.857
not in Buenos Aires, where
there were foreigners coming from Europe.

01:30:05.024 --> 01:30:07.944
So it was a legitimate question
to ask yourself,

01:30:07.944 --> 01:30:11.948
are we emigrating to the United States
or to Argentina in the late 19th century?

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.991
This is what happened back then.

01:30:13.991 --> 01:30:17.453
And this is why also the Argentinian
population looks so European in general.

01:30:17.662 --> 01:30:20.998
And you had in the last World Cup
all these nonsensical articles saying,

01:30:20.998 --> 01:30:25.378
well, why there are no black people
in the soccer team in Argentina and so on.

01:30:25.378 --> 01:30:29.715
This is and, and,
and this is very European population,

01:30:29.715 --> 01:30:34.095
but in the 20s and 30s and then
especially 40s with Juan Domingo Peron,

01:30:34.345 --> 01:30:37.098
who was a fascist general, collectivist,

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:40.101
fascist general, admirer of Mussolini.

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:42.645
He had met Mussolini, actually, in Italy,

01:30:42.645 --> 01:30:44.480
but he was anti-communist
at the same time.

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:48.025
He didn't want the central economy for 
you know, the whole thing, but

01:30:48.401 --> 01:30:51.737
he wanted the corporatist type
of very corrupt economy.

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:54.949
And then they they changed
dramatically the institutions.

01:30:55.032 --> 01:31:00.663
And Argentina became, a declining nation
and a poor nation

01:31:00.663 --> 01:31:04.459
compared to, the rest of the world,
at least the developed world.

01:31:04.876 --> 01:31:07.879
And and what did Millais do?

01:31:07.879 --> 01:31:10.840
Millais managed Millais
and the free market movement,

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:11.966
the classical liberal movement.

01:31:11.966 --> 01:31:13.551
Conservative movement in Argentina.

01:31:13.551 --> 01:31:15.595
I played a role also there.

01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:20.808
so we managed to transform dramatically
the mindset, especially of young people.

01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:23.811
In Argentina,
you are allowed to vote with 16.

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:26.731
So between 16 and 24, Millais

01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:29.734
got 70% of the votes, 70%.

01:31:29.859 --> 01:31:33.237
And this these young people,

01:31:33.779 --> 01:31:37.283
forced the change towards, Millais

01:31:37.283 --> 01:31:41.829
type of very, hardcore
radical, free market, regime,

01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:46.334
but not because people were upset,
because inflation was so high and so on.

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:48.085
No, that was not the reason.

01:31:48.085 --> 01:31:50.505
There is a structural change in Argentina.

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:54.133
All of these people, they would have
they would have been Peronist 20 years ago

01:31:54.133 --> 01:31:57.136
or 30 years ago. Now they already retire.

01:31:57.303 --> 01:31:59.013
And how did we achieve that?

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:02.058
Well, 
a lot of going to media, giving interviews

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:06.229
and especially social media, TikTok,
Instagram and YouTube

01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:09.982
were crucial to change the mentality
of millions of people.

01:32:09.982 --> 01:32:14.445
And of course, the style Millais has,
charisma, a style that is very,

01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:17.698
you know, eccentric,
let's put it that way.

01:32:18.157 --> 01:32:20.451
And he is irreverent.

01:32:20.451 --> 01:32:23.454
He's he has the rhetoric of
a revolutionary, which is very Argentinian

01:32:23.621 --> 01:32:27.166
by the, by the way,
is not really strange in that country.

01:32:27.583 --> 01:32:31.879
he's very theatrical,
but he's also intellectually very solid.

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:37.343
So he came to power, and he's doing
exactly what he said he was going to do.

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:38.177
He didn't lie.

01:32:38.177 --> 01:32:41.722
He said, you know, all all over the
I mean, the last years

01:32:42.014 --> 01:32:45.560
that he has been on television
over the last 5 or 6 years, he has been

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:48.980
saying what was going to happen
and, what it takes to fix it.

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:52.692
Everything came as he predicted,
and now he's in government.

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:58.114
He has brought down inflation
from over 25% a month to less than 4%.

01:32:58.781 --> 01:33:01.784
you know,

01:33:01.951 --> 01:33:05.913
you know, the inflation
in terms of, goods,

01:33:07.123 --> 01:33:10.126
food, it's it's 0%.

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:12.128
So 0% food inflation.

01:33:12.128 --> 01:33:15.298
Then you have, fiscal fiscal surplus

01:33:15.965 --> 01:33:18.050
since since January,
since he came to power,

01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:23.556
you have a fiscal surplus every month
now, consecutive, way.

01:33:23.556 --> 01:33:29.520
And then, you are starting to see,
a little bit of a reactivation

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:35.151
of the economy, because you, you first
had to deal with inflation.

01:33:35.151 --> 01:33:37.153
They were on the verge of hyperinflation.

01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:41.032
If Melaye had not come to power,
you would have inflation at over

01:33:41.032 --> 01:33:43.993
15,000% in Argentina right now,

01:33:44.535 --> 01:33:48.205
15,000% would be the complete catastrophe.

01:33:50.166 --> 01:33:53.544
and he has been a very skillful politician
because he doesn't have

01:33:53.544 --> 01:33:55.087
a majority in Congress.

01:33:55.087 --> 01:33:58.007
But even so, Congress has passed after

01:33:58.007 --> 01:34:01.052
several negotiations
and failed attempts to pass.

01:34:01.218 --> 01:34:05.848
But the Basic Law,
which is a, law that dramatically changes

01:34:05.848 --> 01:34:09.226
the structure of Argentinian economy,
which is really a rent seeking society.

01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:12.855
It's really,
you know, a corporate interests, in bed

01:34:12.855 --> 01:34:17.818
with politicians and exploiting
everyone else for their own Okay. So.

01:34:17.818 --> 01:34:19.487
So let's do let's do this.

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:20.154
Let's do this.

01:34:20.154 --> 01:34:20.988
Let's.

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:25.368
We've got another half an hour
or two to to talk on the daily Wire side

01:34:25.743 --> 01:34:29.747
I think why don't we delve more deeply
into what's happening in Argentina.

01:34:29.747 --> 01:34:32.750
And also to give some consideration
to that

01:34:32.917 --> 01:34:36.379
as a model
for what could occur in South America

01:34:36.379 --> 01:34:40.883
more generally if the leftist utopian tide
could be stemmed.

01:34:41.258 --> 01:34:44.011
So does that seem reasonable to you?

01:34:44.011 --> 01:34:46.472
Alright, let's do that.
So for everybody, good, good.

01:34:46.472 --> 01:34:50.184
So for everybody in watching
and listening, most of you know that I do

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:54.063
an additional half an hour with my guests
on, on the Daily Wear platform.

01:34:54.063 --> 01:34:55.439
And so that's what we're going to do.

01:34:55.439 --> 01:34:59.026
And if you found this discussion
useful and interesting,

01:34:59.276 --> 01:35:01.570
you could give some consideration
to joining us there.

01:35:01.570 --> 01:35:04.740
I can tell further into the sorts
of things that we've been talking about.

01:35:05.157 --> 01:35:06.200
And so,

01:35:07.618 --> 01:35:09.412
and so I think that's what we'll turn to.

01:35:09.412 --> 01:35:14.917
And I would say, thank you to the Daily
Wire for making this discussion possible.

01:35:14.917 --> 01:35:17.044
And, and,

01:35:17.044 --> 01:35:21.507
doctor Kaiser, thank you very much to you
for agreeing to talk to us today.

01:35:21.841 --> 01:35:25.720
obviously, we could talk
for a much longer period of time,

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:28.681
and perhaps we'll do that again
in the not too distant future.

01:35:28.681 --> 01:35:29.473
There's lots of things

01:35:29.473 --> 01:35:33.561
to discuss in more detail
with regard to Venezuela, let's say.

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.731
But for now, we'll
we'll turn our attention to,

01:35:37.523 --> 01:35:39.984
to Argentina and maybe

01:35:39.984 --> 01:35:43.279
with a foray into El Salvador.

01:35:43.487 --> 01:35:46.615
And we'll do that on the daily website
so you can all join us there.

01:35:46.824 --> 01:35:49.577
Thank you very much, sir,
for agreeing to talk to me today.

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:52.413
I know we only scratched the surface,
but at least it's a start.

01:35:53.706 --> 01:35:56.709
much for having me.

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:04.842
You mean.
