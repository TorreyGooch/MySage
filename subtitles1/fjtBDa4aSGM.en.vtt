00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 align:start position:0%
thing that comes to mind okay so what we
 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.470 align:start position:0%
thing that comes to mind okay so what we

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
would see first is that the first thing

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820 align:start position:0%

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 align:start position:0%

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.490 align:start position:0%

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 align:start position:0%
okay so then you can think about that as
 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
okay so then you can think about that as

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 align:start position:0%
a common response right and so that's a
 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%

that's what creativity is roughly

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:31.830 align:start position:0%
it in two different dimensions so that's
 

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:32.990 align:start position:0%
it in two different dimensions so that's

creative thinking

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
but then creative achievement would be
 

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
but then creative achievement would be
the<00:10:35.040><c> ability</c><00:10:35.460><c> to</c><00:10:35.490><c> take</c><00:10:35.850><c> those</c><00:10:36.180><c> original</c><00:10:36.930><c> ideas</c>

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:37.290 align:start position:0%
the ability to take those original ideas
 

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.870 align:start position:0%
the ability to take those original ideas
and<00:10:37.560><c> then</c><00:10:37.650><c> actually</c><00:10:38.010><c> to</c><00:10:38.130><c> implement</c><00:10:38.610><c> them</c><00:10:38.760><c> in</c>

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
the world and that's obviously much more

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.090 align:start position:0%

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.050 align:start position:0%
so and then what creativity is depends
 

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.420 align:start position:0%
so and then what creativity is depends

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.100 align:start position:0%
when you're designing a questionnaire
you<00:17:46.790><c> want</c><00:17:46.940><c> to</c><00:17:47.000><c> be</c><00:17:47.090><c> over-inclusive</c><00:17:47.630><c> because</c>

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:48.110 align:start position:0%
you want to be over-inclusive because
 

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.570 align:start position:0%
you want to be over-inclusive because
the<00:17:48.260><c> statistics</c><00:17:48.470><c> will</c><00:17:48.950><c> take</c><00:17:49.160><c> care</c><00:17:49.340><c> of</c><00:17:49.400><c> it</c>

so we did start with a pretty wide range
we<00:18:14.130><c> thought</c><00:18:14.279><c> okay</c><00:18:14.549><c> well</c><00:18:14.700><c> what</c><00:18:14.850><c> domains</c><00:18:15.270><c> can</c>

you be creative in visual arts painting
and<00:18:18.720><c> sculpture</c><00:18:19.049><c> then</c><00:18:19.320><c> we</c><00:18:19.470><c> had</c><00:18:19.650><c> experts</c><00:18:20.130><c> sort</c>

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
and sculpture then we had experts sort
 

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.490 align:start position:0%

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:32.970 align:start position:0%
vulnerability increases as you lose and
 

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
vulnerability increases as you lose and
then<00:35:33.000><c> maybe</c><00:35:33.390><c> you've</c><00:35:33.570><c> got</c><00:35:33.720><c> to</c><00:35:33.840><c> say</c><00:35:33.960><c> six</c><00:35:34.260><c> people</c>

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:34.410 align:start position:0%
then maybe you've got to say six people
 

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:36.770 align:start position:0%
then maybe you've got to say six people
play<00:35:34.740><c> Monopoly</c><00:35:35.220><c> soon</c><00:35:35.670><c> one</c><00:35:35.910><c> person</c><00:35:36.330><c> has</c><00:35:36.480><c> zero</c>

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
what happens when they have zero they're
 

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
what happens when they have zero they're

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:41.970 align:start position:0%
out of the game so zero is a weird
 

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
