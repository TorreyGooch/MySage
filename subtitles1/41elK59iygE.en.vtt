00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
and that thin theological view that some&nbsp;
Christians have of what it is to have faith&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.900
is profoundly wrong it is unbiblical and and&nbsp;
that's where we have drifted to this idea that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.960
people say I can be against something in my mind&nbsp;
but I don't have to do anything about it [Music]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.780
hello everyone watching and listening today&nbsp;
I'm speaking with author speaker radio host an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.040
incorrigible Eric mataxis we discuss his most&nbsp;
recent book a letter to the American Church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:56.700
which argues that it's a betrayal of Faith to stay&nbsp;
silent in the face of tyranny we parallel the rise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.120
of the wannabe Arbiters of speech across history&nbsp;
against those making themselves manifest today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.320
and detail the responsibility to act against&nbsp;
falsehood that's an intrinsic part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.380
abrahamic tradition although increasingly&nbsp;
non-existent in the American church today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.600
so you recently wrote letter to the American&nbsp;
church I released a podcast a while back or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.100
I guess it was just a monologue which was&nbsp;
message to Christians and uh so obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.040
to some degree we're thinking along parallel&nbsp;
lines Why did you think it was necessary to write&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.060
a letter to the American Church what did you&nbsp;
mean by the American church and uh tell us about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.380
the letter and what the consequences of writing&nbsp;
that was that was 2022 that was released right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.160 --> 00:02:00.900
yes um I uh I'm I'm large uh I contain multitudes&nbsp;
you know who said that I believe it was Chris&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.960
Christie just kidding uh I I'm very eclectic&nbsp;
I'm very eclectic and I have to tell you that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.380
um some people know me principally as a writer&nbsp;
because I've written whatever 14 plus books&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.480
many children's books uh I do of course um radio&nbsp;
show TV show and so on and so forth but almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.620
everything that I do I do for everyone in other&nbsp;
words I'm trying to reach uh a broad audience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.500
not just I want to sell more books but because I I&nbsp;
feel God created me to speak to a popular audience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.340
to to a wide audience this most recent book which&nbsp;
is my shortest book letter to the American Church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:51.540
um is the first time I have ever written&nbsp;
something specifically only for those who claim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.200
to be Christians I thought to myself well I&nbsp;
shouldn't say I thought to myself I've I had a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:06.120
I had a number of thoughts rambling around in my&nbsp;
head that became increasingly highlighted uh in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.340
a way that I couldn't uh I don't know how some&nbsp;
people will take this but but I've never felt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:20.280
God called me to write something the way he did&nbsp;
this book in retrospect all of my books Bonhoeffer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.720
and so on and so forth it's it's it's exceedingly&nbsp;
clear to me that God's hand was in my writing them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:37.020
but never have I felt a burning passion that I&nbsp;
knew was God calling me to write this specific&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.620
book so it's a strange and unique thing in my&nbsp;
experience there's a uh you know if you think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.720
of of the title letter to the American Church it&nbsp;
would be natural to think what kind of hubris are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.860
we talking about here that somebody would dare uh&nbsp;
to write letter to the American church as though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.460
he's a modern day Paul or something like that but&nbsp;
on the contrary because I felt it was God wanting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.420
to say this uh I had more humility than ever&nbsp;
in writing it thinking that I cannot get this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.440
wrong I have to really be sure to take myself&nbsp;
out of the way as much as as possible to to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.320
let God say what he wants to to say and I don't&nbsp;
mean this in any mystical sense but I was very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.160
um soberminded to write something with a title&nbsp;
letter to the American church and the reason I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:34.500
wrote it in a nutshell is that um in 2010 I&nbsp;
came out with my my longest book a biography&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.520
of Dietrich Bonhoeffer the German Pastor who&nbsp;
was involved in the plot to kill Hitler um I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.480
knew when I was writing that book uh that it it&nbsp;
sort of I could I could smell what was happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.760
as I was writing that book I could smell that in&nbsp;
our future in the west not just in America but in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:03.540
America specifically and in with the events of the&nbsp;
last few years uh let's say the last three years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:15.780
um it was impossible for me to avoid the thought&nbsp;
that just as the Silence of the church in Germany&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:24.360
opened the door to Hell on Earth which we now&nbsp;
know because we know what happened and of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.860
I documented in my Bonhoeffer book and in this&nbsp;
new booklet to the American church but I but but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.780
the thesis of this book letter to the American&nbsp;
church is that precisely as the German church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:41.700
was silent and precisely as that opened the door&nbsp;
to hell to every kind of evil it is the silence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:53.820
of the church in America now this minute that is&nbsp;
similarly opening the door to hellish uh things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:03.360
on a number of fronts the the parallels are so&nbsp;
marked even the parallel of the excuses given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:11.460
by uh theologians and Christians in the 30s who&nbsp;
said we don't want to speak out against Hitler we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.900
don't want to these are our reasons dramatically&nbsp;
similar parallels among many uh evangelicals and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:26.520
others in the American church today for why they&nbsp;
are being silent on issues that they ought to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:35.940
screaming about issues that you and others have&nbsp;
shouted about the evil of the transgender uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:43.440
lunacy and on and on and on and on so I I said to&nbsp;
myself I can't believe it but the parallels are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:51.600
are so dramatic uh to The Silence of the church&nbsp;
in Germany that I am just burning to to speak this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:02.220
hoping and praying that God in his grace would use&nbsp;
it to wake up those who might be awakened we know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:10.440
that some people will insist on sleep walking to&nbsp;
the abyss that they're they they cannot be reached&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:18.420
but I know that in Germany in the 30s there were&nbsp;
many good pastors who got this wrong many good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:26.280
pastors who were fooled um deceived uh who allowed&nbsp;
themselves to be deceived until it was too late&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:33.900
many of them woke up and then it was too late to&nbsp;
do anything so I wrote this book hoping to reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:40.800
those specifically who call themselves Christians&nbsp;
who dare to call themselves Christians uh with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:48.480
the idea that they would say yes I have been&nbsp;
complicit in my silence in my inaction uh these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:56.700
excuses are not biblically based I must speak&nbsp;
out okay so let me ask you there's a lot there so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.760
let me go through some of the questions that&nbsp;
we might address I'd like to know what you mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:11.400
by God's hand say rather than your hand in your&nbsp;
writing and so that people can understand exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.620
what you mean by that and how that appears to you&nbsp;
and how you distinguish your voice let's say from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:24.720
from the spirit of inspiration then I'd like&nbsp;
to know what events of the last three years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.060
that you you think are particularly problematic&nbsp;
because there's no Hitler staring Us in the face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:36.840
at the moment so that's the obvious historical&nbsp;
parallel there's systems of Warring ideas and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.600
and you're you're on the Christian side of&nbsp;
that war let's say you said dare to call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:49.980
themselves Christian which is an interesting uh an&nbsp;
interesting phrase so let's start let's start with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:57.000
your description of some of the books that you've&nbsp;
written is that you know they were inspired you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.460
know and my sense is that you can separate out an&nbsp;
attempt to write a book for instrumental Reasons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:12.360
from an attempt to write a book to put forth&nbsp;
what you believe to be true right now they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.080
mingled a little bit because you you sort&nbsp;
of have to select your audience although&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:22.020
when I wrote myself everything is by definition&nbsp;
mingled there's there's no yeah there's no getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:27.780
around that unless unless you know a a demon is&nbsp;
speaking and you're doing automatic ghost writing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:34.440
or something like that in other words the we are&nbsp;
created in God's image and inevitably you can say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.880
this about the New Testament itself about the&nbsp;
New and Old Testaments I mean they're inspired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:49.080
but Paul does not erase his personality to&nbsp;
speak uh for God God created Paul with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:56.880
personality so that God could use the medium of&nbsp;
the human being that is Paul to to say what God&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.460
has to say so it's it's different from you&nbsp;
know there are people I know who will hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.440
the voice of God they will hear God speak a&nbsp;
sentence or speak a scripture or something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:15.360
um I'm not talking about that uh that happens&nbsp;
but that didn't happen to me for me it was and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.600
it's a funny thing it's like develop a muscle&nbsp;
where you become increasingly sensitive to uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.120
you're able to use it and and I think literally&nbsp;
over the decades I've become more sensitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:38.520
to um to um in other words in the past I&nbsp;
think uh you know I've since I became a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:48.960
Christian uh you know rather dramatically in&nbsp;
1988 I have all I wanted every moment God to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:57.960
use me to to use me in my gifts uh uh which are&nbsp;
strange and various and I and I've always uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:04.860
assumed that that he would and that he was doing&nbsp;
that and in the various books that I've written&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:11.760
and the various things that I've done even in the&nbsp;
jokes that I've cracked that God is with me but um

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:23.040
over the over the years I've become a little bit&nbsp;
more sensitive to these moments where I feel I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.920
would say you know God is particularly in this I&nbsp;
can sort of feel it it's almost like a highlighter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.020
going over something the words are the same but&nbsp;
you could sort of see this highlighted the text&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:39.300
is highlighted or something like that I don't mean&nbsp;
that specifically with with my books I'm speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:45.240
about talking about my thoughts and things that&nbsp;
I think that these these thoughts feel like God&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:51.540
is uh particularly behind them could I be vager&nbsp;
I'll try no no no no no no this is a hard thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.440
to get right so you know there's going to be&nbsp;
some wandering about in the darkness trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:01.800
get it right I mean one of the things I try to do&nbsp;
when I'm speaking and also when I'm writing is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:07.620
feel I I would I wouldn't use a visual metaphor&nbsp;
for me it's more like feeling my way forward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:14.460
for toe holes I the image that always comes&nbsp;
to mind for me is walking across a swamp&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.420
of dirty water where there's Stone&nbsp;
pathway underneath and then you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:23.220
feel out with my feet if the next&nbsp;
thing I'm standing on is well water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:31.560
or or crocodile or or solid ground and I'm&nbsp;
always searching for that sense of solidity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.800
but it's interesting there's a presupposition in&nbsp;
what you're saying that there is a path forward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.960
there's a right way in a wrong way and that's&nbsp;
that's a presupposition that you've just put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.980
out there in other words you operate with that&nbsp;
piece of position there's such a thing as truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:54.000
and I don't want to get it wrong and that&nbsp;
alone is right is a big thing to to put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.980
that out there right well I would say that&nbsp;
well I agree well it's truth right well I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:06.420
think that's Akin in some ways to to your claim&nbsp;
that you're you're attempting to be directed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:12.180
as close as you can manage to divine inspiration&nbsp;
when you're writing I mean it isn't it isn't a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.560
set of axiomatic statements like I do believe but&nbsp;
forgive me for interrupting but it's gonna it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.980
gonna sound like I'm claiming that that I'm being&nbsp;
led by God and everything I write I don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:31.920
say that I'm just basically I'm I'm a writer I'm&nbsp;
a speaker I do my best the only time uh I felt

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:41.700
something more palpable of of God's inspiration&nbsp;
was in writing a letter to the American church I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:51.480
I felt like I've never written anything as&nbsp;
as sobering and Urgent and so I had a more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:59.760
keen sense that I really need to get this right&nbsp;
because what I'm saying is so serious and and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:07.260
urgent uh so but I don't want to imply that there&nbsp;
was anything uh mystical about it or that every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:13.500
word was uh you know chosen by God but I just&nbsp;
had I suppose a sense of humility something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:20.100
there is something I suppose&nbsp;
mystical about that intuition that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.200
there's a distinction between words that&nbsp;
are false and words that are true yeah and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.420
it isn't easy exactly to describe how you know&nbsp;
the difference I mean you know the difference&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.920
the way you know the difference between truth and&nbsp;
falsehood if you do in fact know that difference&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.780
and haven't clouded your mind up too bad it's&nbsp;
no different than the instinct to know what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:45.420
it it's no different really than the instinct&nbsp;
to know what's funny if you're a jokester right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:53.940
right I am to know the timing of why would&nbsp;
it be funnier if I hesitate if I if I if I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.940 --> 00:15:01.260
if I if I stutter the phrase uh why will it be&nbsp;
funnier that the timing all those things are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:08.640
instincts that uh we all develop in our various&nbsp;
ways through life or at least ideally we that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:16.260
we would so it has something to do with that it&nbsp;
becomes it doesn't feel conscious uh it it feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:22.080
like something that it's it's an inner knowing&nbsp;
a sense of of things but uh I mean I've I've had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:31.980
numerous genuinely mystical experiences uh&nbsp;
miraculous experiences um but that's not what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:38.580
I'm talking about here here I'm talking about just&nbsp;
what it is to be a writer uh but as I say it kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.360
of became pointed with letter to the American&nbsp;
church because of the seriousness of what I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:48.060
writing well okay so let's let's turn to that&nbsp;
now because of the seriousness of what you were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.440
writing and you pointed specifically to the events&nbsp;
of the last three years and this is probably we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:57.540
get this whole discussion canceled on YouTube by&nbsp;
the way good because that's increasingly happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:04.620
yeah well three they've taken three of my videos&nbsp;
down in the last month by the way um so um what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:10.620
is it exactly that you think is afoot why do you&nbsp;
think it's akin to the source of things that were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:15.300
happening while the totalitarian state was rising&nbsp;
in Germany and you've just you've just said it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:28.080
the YouTube canceling your your conversations how&nbsp;
extraordinarily Preposterous and sick is that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:37.080
mind-bending that in the west we would have some&nbsp;
Arbiters out there deciding what is okay and what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:43.560
is not okay that's despicable as speaking as an&nbsp;
American it is profoundly anti-American I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:51.900
of the blood of patriots who died for freedom for&nbsp;
freedom of speech so it is on the one hand deeply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:59.040
offensive to me in that way but as a human being&nbsp;
it's deeply offensive to me uh as a Christian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:06.840
it's offensive to me because I believe that we&nbsp;
are all free to speak truth so the idea that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:12.960
we would be alive at a Time in the West where&nbsp;
in places like Canada and America and the West&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:22.620
somebody would dare would dare to be shutting&nbsp;
down what you and I and most people know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:31.740
are perfectly wonderful conversations we know that&nbsp;
it's not like well yeah I guess they had a point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:44.460
they had less than no point and by my show the&nbsp;
Eric matax's show was flourishing on YouTube uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.580
getting more and more subscribers I'm very&nbsp;
eclectic so uh I'm you know some of it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.380
comedy some of it is serious discussions about&nbsp;
faith some of it is politics some of it is I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:03.120
interviewing uh uh authors about their books&nbsp;
two years ago I dared to have Naomi wolf who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:08.520
was one of my classmates at Yale uh liberal&nbsp;
feminist I had her on the show I interviewed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:14.340
to talk about I know yeah to talk about yeah&nbsp;
vaccine I didn't even choose the subject&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:20.460
I had a few other people on the show to talk&nbsp;
about some things but the show was not focused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:27.960
you know on on those kinds of things but you too&nbsp;
wiped my program out completely didn't just take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:34.440
some videos down wiped the entire program the&nbsp;
Erica Texas show ceased to exist on YouTube&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.040
and I thought to myself if you're standing back&nbsp;
objectively looking at the situation you'd say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:45.420
well that's interesting why would they do that&nbsp;
in other words this is not uh this doesn't look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:52.080
good for the people at YouTube they look like&nbsp;
fascists they are acting in a fascist way they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:58.560
are globalists they are uh cultural marxists but&nbsp;
of course there's a good dose of fascism in there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:04.680
they don't believe in Freedom they don't believe&nbsp;
in free speech they have an agenda and they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:14.280
tremendous power which they are now using because&nbsp;
as we all know they are scared to death of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:20.340
truth they are so scared that they're willing&nbsp;
to look like the monsters that they are because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:25.980
they have nothing left to lose so when we say&nbsp;
what are the parallels to to Germany in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:32.040
30s you don't suppose that in 1933 most people&nbsp;
knew what was coming nobody could have dreamed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:39.000
of the death camps I mean they didn't discuss&nbsp;
the final solution for another eight years uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.160
nobody saw what was coming but people with eyes&nbsp;
to see people like Dietrich Bonhoeffer they could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:52.800
smell this they said um if you follow the dots&nbsp;
they lead in this direction the people who are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:52.800 --> 00:20:00.420
seizing power now and being allowed to seize&nbsp;
power now by cowardly people by confused people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:08.580
those people trying to seize power when they get&nbsp;
the power they're going to use it for very Wicked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:17.280
ends their presuppositions are the antitheses&nbsp;
of our presuppositions they are atheistic they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:24.480
don't believe in good or evil they only believe&nbsp;
in power and and the cultural Elites the globalist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:32.700
cultural Elites today are working with the same&nbsp;
presuppositions they couldn't care less about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:38.700
things that most of us would would take for&nbsp;
granted the Dignity of the human being the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:45.240
sanctity of Life all of these things that people&nbsp;
have uh lived for and died for they are not only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:53.520
uh not interested in those ideas they're at war&nbsp;
with those ideas and so there are you know some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:53.520 --> 00:21:00.600
parallels that we can make and some that we can&nbsp;
make but but basically we you and I have never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:06.480
seen anything like this in the west and it's it's&nbsp;
it's astonishing the speed at which these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:13.800
have been happening in the last week YouTube&nbsp;
took down my discussion about what is a woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:21.840
and Associated issues in that direction with Matt&nbsp;
Walsh and they took down a video that was a year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:28.680
old that I did with Helen Joyce who's an economist&nbsp;
journalist and a very credible person on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:37.080
trans minor surgery scandals in the UK which have&nbsp;
resulted in the change of a number of UK policies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:43.980
not that podcast specifically but those issues&nbsp;
but most relevant as far as I'm concerned they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:50.640
took down a discussion I had with Robert F Kennedy&nbsp;
and the reason for that in principle was he veered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:59.280
into the vaccination criticism domain and you know&nbsp;
it's not like I walk arm and arm across the desert&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.860
with Robert F Kennedy I think he's an interesting&nbsp;
person he's a bull in the china shop just like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:12.120
Trump and God only knows what he's up to or what&nbsp;
he'll do but but here's the issue he's running for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:17.580
president and he's in the middle of a presidential&nbsp;
campaign and YouTube took down one of his videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.460
and I'm looking at this from outside my country&nbsp;
Canada is as screwy as you can possibly imagine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:30.360
and then some but I never expected to see this&nbsp;
in the United States that a corporation would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.160
interfere with an ongoing presidential candidates&nbsp;
in the United States is it I mean when you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:41.460
dealing with Google any of these companies they&nbsp;
are and this is an interesting thing and this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:48.420
why if you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for money you don't care&nbsp;
whether someone is patriotic or has any Fidelity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:58.080
to American principles and most people most&nbsp;
politicians don't care uh but we need to care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:08.040
so the idea that you would have Google uh allying&nbsp;
itself with China and uh you know as I say why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:14.340
for money okay what could be more difficult well&nbsp;
you know I well no no I can tell you something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:21.720
that's more Despicable than that I think that if&nbsp;
you're whoring for money so to speak that there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.220
actually something predictable and admirable&nbsp;
about that and let me lay the argument out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:32.820
okay partly because if I know that you were are&nbsp;
actually motivated by money and even if that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:37.020
your single there's there's nothing wrong with&nbsp;
being motivated by that but you you and I know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:43.020
that there are limits if somebody says um you&nbsp;
know it's like that scene in the third man uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:47.580
if I know I can make a certain amount of money&nbsp;
Orson welles's character you know if a few of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:53.760
those people disappear who cares in other words&nbsp;
this has always been the question right somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.540
says well you you can make a lot of money but&nbsp;
it's going to involve you're aligning yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.440
with people who are torturing and murdering and&nbsp;
sexually abusing people are you okay with that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:09.240
most people would say I hope no some people say&nbsp;
well I don't know um but the point is what we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:16.020
talking about right now is people who are looking&nbsp;
the other way they would gladly do business with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:22.440
slave Traders they would gladly do business with&nbsp;
the Nazis if they could make a buck they cynically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.760
some of them believe listen if I'm not going&nbsp;
to make a buck here someone else will I might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:32.700
as well make a buck and that's what we're dealing&nbsp;
with now with all of these globalist corporations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:38.460
well I think it's worse on the YouTube front&nbsp;
because they've left me alone up till now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.880
and I think that what they're doing to buttress&nbsp;
their ideology is actually counterproductive at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.620
least in this situation on the economic front the&nbsp;
thing that frightens me about the YouTube video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:55.680
log types is that I think that they would act&nbsp;
even against their own narrow economic self-inter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.660
correct push their damage well that's what I mean&nbsp;
by worse if you're honestly greeting I agree with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:07.080
you no no no no okay I agree with you okay but the&nbsp;
point is it's mixed the point is yes when Hitler&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:16.200
uh took over in in the 30s um some people&nbsp;
it's just like today's exactly like today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.160
because this is human nature they simply&nbsp;
didn't want quote unquote any trouble so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.700
they were willing to look the other way&nbsp;
when something bad was happening there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:28.320
were some people didn't want to lose their job so&nbsp;
there's an economic thing but the point is evil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:35.820
never operates in a vacuum it works with&nbsp;
things like human interest and the question is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:44.700
there's this amalgam of things going on for some&nbsp;
it's purest greed how much money can Pfizer and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:51.360
Company make they don't give a damn about&nbsp;
the side effects or the what they're people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.980
who are in it for the money and there's so much&nbsp;
money that they're willing to look the other way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:04.380
there are other people who are pulling the&nbsp;
levers uh other people that uh couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.760
possibly need more money whether it's&nbsp;
George Soros or Bill Gates so it's an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.420
amalgam of things and we're dealing with all&nbsp;
these things we're asking the question how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:17.880
does evil operate that's how evil operates in&nbsp;
in every kind of way and every single person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:27.000
has a choice whether to participate or to say&nbsp;
I refuse to participate I would rather do the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.020
right thing uh and trust God with the results and&nbsp;
that's why in letter to the American church I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:40.860
writing specifically to those people Christians&nbsp;
who claim uh to believe in in the god of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:46.620
Bible to believe that Jesus defeated death on the&nbsp;
cross well if you believe that you are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:53.940
presumably behave differently uh because you&nbsp;
believe that because you have okay so you said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:53.940 --> 00:27:00.120
okay you said something core there you know&nbsp;
um and I finally scored to no no no no no no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.800
no no we're just getting closer and closer to the&nbsp;
point which is a good thing to do in a discussion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:12.000
so you you're implying and also stating explicitly&nbsp;
a theory of Christianity and one of the key points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.580
that you just made was that if you have faith&nbsp;
which by the way I think is a form of courage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:23.700
it's a form of existential courage it's a decision&nbsp;
to stake yourself on something you will you said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:30.600
do the right thing and let God care take care&nbsp;
of the consequences okay so my understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:37.080
of that is that I've been I've been trying to&nbsp;
conceptualize faith I suppose to some degree and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:42.540
you know the atheist types and the materialists&nbsp;
think that faith is the willingness to suspend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:48.120
disbelief in the service of a fairy tale and I&nbsp;
think that faith is something entirely different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:55.140
than that I think it's the willingness to stake&nbsp;
yourself on the truth in the faith that whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:00.540
happens when you tell the truth is the best thing&nbsp;
that could possibly happen and not regardless of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:05.400
the short-term consequences right because people&nbsp;
lie because they want to manipulate the short-term&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:10.140
consequences they think they can get away with it&nbsp;
they think they'll gain something from it okay so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:15.660
I think no no you tell the truth and sometimes&nbsp;
you're going to pay a price for that but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:20.580
nowhere near as much of a price as you're bloody&nbsp;
well going to pay if you lie now you might be too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:27.000
stupid and willfully blind and naive and crooked&nbsp;
and devious and deceptive to understand that but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.740
doesn't mean you're right so this so you said&nbsp;
do the right thing and let God take care of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:36.840
the consequences well that's the statement of&nbsp;
faith now this letter you wrote is that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:42.180
message that you're sending to the to the American&nbsp;
church are you telling people say what you believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:47.460
to be the case or suffer the consequences&nbsp;
is it or is that is that the central issue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:53.640
uh in a word yes yes uh those were that was two&nbsp;
words but it was the same word so it counts as one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:53.640 --> 00:29:03.240
word yes uh that's the thesis if someone claims&nbsp;
uh to believe in the god of the Bible which I do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:13.860
um then there's no question that God requires of&nbsp;
us to behave as though we believe what we claim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:23.160
to believe and one of the Theses of my book letter&nbsp;
to the American church is that just as the German&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:32.340
Church drifted tragically um in its conception&nbsp;
of what is Faith so to the American church has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:40.800
drifted in other words they have adopted a kind&nbsp;
of uh Enlightenment rationalist view of faith&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:47.580
faith is what I believe which means what I what I&nbsp;
believe intellectually I sent to I assent to these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:52.620
ideas so I ticked these boxes these theological&nbsp;
boxes somebody says what do you believe and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:56.460
say well go go to the website of my church there's&nbsp;
a statement of faith that's what I believed well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:05.460
that's a fig Leaf it does not fool God it does&nbsp;
not fool the devil if you actually believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:13.800
what the Bible says what the Nicene Creed says if&nbsp;
you actually believe those things you will behave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:19.320
as though you believe those things it will&nbsp;
affect your life you will live with courage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:29.400
um because you know too much not to live with&nbsp;
courage you're afraid of living fearfully so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:36.000
I thought to myself that idea Bonhoeffer wrote a&nbsp;
book uh the cost of discipleship where he famously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
talks about cheap Grace because the excuse given&nbsp;
by the Germans uh the theologians and and pastors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.300
at the time was that well uh it's all about&nbsp;
Grace it's it's less about what we do because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:54.660
Luther said oh we're not saved by our works well&nbsp;
congratulations you're correct you're not saved by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:54.660 --> 00:31:02.760
your Works however there is a little scripture in&nbsp;
the Epistle of James that says faith without works&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:10.500
is dead in other words if you're foolish enough to&nbsp;
believe that you can have faith and not events it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:18.360
in how you live then you're a fool then actually&nbsp;
biblically you have no faith and so I think that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:25.020
that bad idea about Grace and Faith which you&nbsp;
know we we get and again these are always you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:30.600
know these are good ideas taken to extremes right&nbsp;
oh you know faith is what I believe uh yes that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:38.220
that's a nice idea but it can become unmoored from&nbsp;
the reality that what you believe has to be lived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:43.800
out it has to be an integral part of of who you&nbsp;
are it has to be holistic and and the Germans were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:48.240
particularly guilty of this and what I'm saying is&nbsp;
that the American church is particularly guilty of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.980
this today and it's always manifested in the idea&nbsp;
that oh we shouldn't be political and I thought to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:52.980 --> 00:32:00.840
myself what that's preposterous if if if you're&nbsp;
against slavery uh and you you live in the mid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:06.960
19th century uh people will say oh you're you're&nbsp;
being political just stick to the gospel well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.280
that's what Hitler said to the pastors just stick&nbsp;
to your little your little gospel I'll worry about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.540
the Third Reich I'll worry about everything else&nbsp;
you just worry about your little Theology and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:22.920
thin theological view that some Christians have of&nbsp;
what it is to have faith is profoundly wrong it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:29.940
unbiblical your theology has to be lived out it&nbsp;
has to be integrated into every part of your life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:37.380
um and and that's where we have drifted to this&nbsp;
idea that people say I can be against something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:43.140
in my mind but I don't have to do anything about&nbsp;
it I don't have to live out my life heroically I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:48.300
don't have to put my life on the line I don't have&nbsp;
to put my career on the line if you believe these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:53.400
things then of course you have to put your life in&nbsp;
your career on the line otherwise it's obvious you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:53.400 --> 00:33:01.020

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:28.380
Okay so The Works issue this is how I understand&nbsp;
it you tell me what you think about this if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:34.740
would so what I thought Luther was trying to&nbsp;
establish and I think this is wise is that just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:41.820
because you have the Privileges of a king doesn't&nbsp;
mean that you're uh what walking the road to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:47.640
to the kingdom of heaven right the mere fact that&nbsp;
you've been provided with or perhaps even earned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:55.860
that's more complicated with a certain degree of&nbsp;
material Prosperity isn't uh a signal message from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:02.640
God that you are on the right side of things&nbsp;
so you can't confuse works with Grace or with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:08.700
Redemption and you can't assume that someone who's&nbsp;
rich is a more moral agent than someone who's poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:14.100
merely because they have plenty so that's the&nbsp;
point I think Luther was trying to make that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:22.860
my I actually I wrote a uh 450 Page biography&nbsp;
of Luther uh and nowhere in my book do I touch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:29.460
on that idea so I think it may follow from some of&nbsp;
what Luther says but I don't think principally he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:36.240
I mean what you just said is an important point&nbsp;
but I don't get it from Luther I mean I get it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:43.500
from other places he he doesn't seem to me ever&nbsp;
to have worried about that that doesn't seem to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:50.940
uh on on the list of things he was dealing with uh&nbsp;
yeah well I could walk back my claim I I would say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:58.020
then in that that my understanding is that that's&nbsp;
the underlying rationale of the Protestant claim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:03.420
that you're not saved by works it's more that the&nbsp;
works themselves and their manifestation aren't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:09.960
inevitable proof of of what would you say God's&nbsp;
appreciation for your existence all right let me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:17.100
let me uh let me put it this way the the point and&nbsp;
I think my dear friend Dennis Prager and I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:24.960
would differ on this and it came out in your&nbsp;
conversation with him but I think the idea uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.280
you know one of the principal ideas of the New&nbsp;
Testament and one of the principal things that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:37.140
Jesus was trying to say to clarify you know uh why&nbsp;
uh many of the religious leaders of his time were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:52.500
off was that um what you what you think uh your&nbsp;
inner life is vital is is is Central so if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:52.500 --> 00:37:01.020
write a big check to some wonderful charity um&nbsp;
yes it counts it goes to to help you know medical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:06.660
research for uh cancer in children yes that's&nbsp;
there's a reality there but if in your heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:15.660
you only did it uh to impress some woman that&nbsp;
you want to sleep with God sees that he doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:21.000
just grade you on the externals he's interested&nbsp;
in your heart in the disposition of your heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:29.340
um and so so Luther uh I mean there's so much&nbsp;
to there's so much to Luther but I think the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:37.200
issue is that Luther was making this distinction&nbsp;
what what he was worried about was this idea that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:42.420
uh you know you go through the mumbo jumbo and&nbsp;
the rigmarole of the church and that's all that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:49.080
counts and he was saying no no no no no no uh it&nbsp;
is your faith that counts and in other words right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:54.180
and you're and you're making an existential case&nbsp;
in some ways for that Faith which is that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:59.820
not Ascent to a series of explicit propositions&nbsp;
but a mode of conducting yourself in the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:06.780
and part of that mode is that you say what&nbsp;
you you say what strikes you as true that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:12.000
what you do that's how you live your life and&nbsp;
if you do that well that's part parcel well it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.060
reveals Christian faith yes it reveals that you&nbsp;
a that you believe there's such a thing as truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:25.380
and B that you believe that the&nbsp;
author of that truth who is god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:31.500
um is with you in this in other words you don't&nbsp;
say well hey I'm just gonna I'm just gonna do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:37.680
this because it's the noble thing it's like no&nbsp;
no I believe in a reality where God is with me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:45.180
and only with me when I speak the truth and live&nbsp;
the truth and I can trust him with the results&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:52.260
um trust yourself how do you trust yourself&nbsp;
like so fair enough I I buy the argument I I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:58.020
think it's I think it's accurate I think it's the&nbsp;
most accurate argument some ways but then you come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:03.840
to the next problem which is well there's God and&nbsp;
then there's you and you're just a confused human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:10.620
being and so how the hell how do you take steps to&nbsp;
ensure that your judgment about what constitutes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:19.320
the truth is reliable even in your own eyes&nbsp;
well first of all you have to want it to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:26.640
you have to care you you have to uh have enough&nbsp;
humility to know that you could get it wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:33.960
um and therefore to cast yourself on God and&nbsp;
say Lord help me because I know that I'm a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:39.720
fallen sinful uh human being I got that much&nbsp;
that's clear to me and so it without your help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:47.220
I will screw this up um so so it's it's um this is&nbsp;
part and parcel of what it is to be free you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:54.360
that that it comes with risks you can get it wrong&nbsp;
but to be cynical and not to try to get it right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:54.360 --> 00:40:01.860
is really wicked so this cheap Grace you talked&nbsp;
about too which so so I have this interpretation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:09.000
of I'm sure it's not unique to me but of one of&nbsp;
The Commandments which is do not use the lord's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.780
name in vain and people like to think that means&nbsp;
don't swear and I think in a very trivial sense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:21.060
that is what it means but what it really&nbsp;
means as far as I can tell is don't pretend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:26.460
to be doing the work of the Divine when you're&nbsp;
Feathering your own nest right and I really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:31.620
see this as a particularly egregious sin of&nbsp;
the times pride is the sin of the times and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:37.140
so is deception pride and lies and of course I&nbsp;
think those are the two canonical sins in some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:43.920
real sense but this notion of easy moral virtue&nbsp;
almost everything I see on the ideological side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:51.960
appears to me to be an attempt to Proclaim moral&nbsp;
virtue and the accompanying status and perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:58.260
even the pathway to Redemption without doing any&nbsp;
of the work at all and I think the universities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:03.000
are terribly complicit in this because what&nbsp;
they basically tell students is the secular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.380
equivalent I think of what you're complaining&nbsp;
about on the Christian side which is well you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:11.760
don't really have to be a good person which&nbsp;
by the way is a very difficult thing to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:17.700
um and the consequence of not doing that is any&nbsp;
everyone ends up in hell but you don't really have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:23.400
to be a good person you just have to be against&nbsp;
the right things and conveniently that'll require&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:30.000
um you know a little protesting on your part and&nbsp;
conveniently it will enable you to to what would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.120
you say see the devil and everyone else and not&nbsp;
in yourself at all and then you've paid your price&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:41.940
and you can trumpet your moral virtue and Away&nbsp;
you go down the road all of which is a satanic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:51.060
counterfeit of the truth uh I I was at Yale in the&nbsp;
80s and I saw this for the first time I grew up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:59.700
in a working class home um uh no one had gone to&nbsp;
college so here I am uh at Yale and for the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:06.120
time I saw that we didn't know the term virtue&nbsp;
signaling but it was all there already in yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:12.660
so yeah what are you taking in the in the Academy&nbsp;
I was taking penicillin but we can't talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:19.080
that just kidding just kidding no I was I was uh&nbsp;
I guess that's how you Canadians put it I was uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:25.980
I was an English major uh oh yeah yeah English&nbsp;
literature at Yale yeah but but the thing is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:33.780
that that concept well I managed uh to avoid uh&nbsp;
critical theory and and all that although I did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:40.020
once escort Jacques derida across a courtyard with&nbsp;
an umbrella I wrote a poem about it but the point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:47.100
is that while I was there for the first time I&nbsp;
saw the virtue signaling and I was taken in by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:55.740
it I was young and naive and and foolish and I&nbsp;
for the first time saw you don't say this you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:55.740 --> 00:43:03.000
say this uh be careful about this but you know we&nbsp;
we don't say Oriental we say Asian we say this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.100
what we're supposed to believe that we're all of&nbsp;
that kind of stuff and I kind of thought oh well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:15.480
you know to get along because I I have to yes but&nbsp;
it was there in in strength in the 80s already and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:21.840
of course it filtered its way down down down into&nbsp;
the culture and right right from Yale and right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.860
from The English Department as a matter well&nbsp;
that's true that's quite that's quite right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:31.080
quite right yeah it's unpleasant to talk about&nbsp;
so let's avoid it but but um the point is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:38.640
it is ultimately I mean there's great irony irony&nbsp;
is is the happy way of putting it it's it's uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:48.060
think about this you're dealing with cultural&nbsp;
Marxism they don't believe in God they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:55.140
believe in truth they don't believe in good or&nbsp;
evil they believe in nothing but power but somehow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:03.300
they have to cannibalize truth and they have to&nbsp;
talk about things like racism and they have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:07.620
talk about things like that's right and that's&nbsp;
wrong and we care about the marginalized and of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:14.400
course what we want to ask is excuse me why do&nbsp;
you care about those things in others you say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:22.500
racism is wrong I agree but I know why it's wrong&nbsp;
why do you say that it's wrong if you don't get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:28.860
your values from the Bible which says that we're&nbsp;
all created equal in God's image if you get your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:34.620
values from quote unquote science and blind&nbsp;
Darwinism then who's to say that some people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:40.560
aren't more evolved than others in other words&nbsp;
according to what you claim to believe you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:47.640
zero basis on which to make any claims about&nbsp;
morality about what's right or wrong so you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:53.340
gaslighting all of us you're telling us shut up&nbsp;
don't ask questions do this don't do that don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:53.340 --> 00:45:02.040
say this don't say that and everybody is kind&nbsp;
of uh bullied into going along with it oh okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:08.340
okay but we ought to say excuse me you know not&nbsp;
only are you wrong about everything you're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:15.540
you don't even have any basis on which to make&nbsp;
any of these claims so the idea that this was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:23.940
uh born in you know derida Foucault critical race&nbsp;
Theory critical theory uh gram sheet this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:34.380
bubbles its way through the decades until here we&nbsp;
are living with Madness on every front we are to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:40.560
be pro-reality is to be a radical in this day and&nbsp;
age to be a revolutionary and a radical is to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:47.940
pro-reality so let me throw another idea at you&nbsp;
so I've been doing a lot of writing and thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:53.220
about the biblical stories well for a very long&nbsp;
time and very intensely recently and I've spent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:59.100
many many hundreds of hours I suppose thinking&nbsp;
about the story of Cain and Abel which is a story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:07.560
that never ceases to terrify me right to my core&nbsp;
and what you see in that story is the the story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:14.220
of two principalities making themselves manifest&nbsp;
in some way for the first time right so you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:21.000
Abel who makes the proper sacrifices who dedicates&nbsp;
himself to God who looks upward and does what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.600
actually necessary and true and reaps the benefit&nbsp;
as a consequence and then you have Cain who you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:32.640
know he's not so much into the sacrifice thing&nbsp;
and his sacrifices are second raid and he's trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:37.620
to pull the wool over the eyes of God and that&nbsp;
doesn't work out very well and so then he calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:42.720
God on God's misbehavior and says to him I don't&nbsp;
know what sort of Cosmos you think you hacked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:47.640
together here but I'm busting myself in pieces&nbsp;
and all I get is misery why don't you straighten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:52.680
yourself up and God says well if you did things&nbsp;
properly things would probably go okay for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:58.860
and that makes Cain murderously angry and envious&nbsp;
and resentful and bitter and cynical and so then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:04.560
he goes and kills Abel and I think that's exactly&nbsp;
what's happening today is that what we point to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:11.640
as Marxism is just the most recent rational&nbsp;
manifestation of the eternal spirit of Cain

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:18.180
I think that's accurate I think you're a&nbsp;
pretty sharp cookie I think you're ready to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:25.260
go professional uh honestly that's the one all in&nbsp;
man you no but I mean that's that's a wonderful uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:31.800
exegesis I I had never thought of that really but&nbsp;
uh it seems to me dead on and I think that it only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:39.240
took me 40 years to think it through yes well but&nbsp;
it's but but the thing is what you just said uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:44.820
I don't remember your phrasing but it's the same&nbsp;
thing over and over and over again in other words&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:51.000
we're talking about human nature right and in fact&nbsp;
you see this happen even earlier in scripture uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:58.140
than Cain and Abel when uh when Adam and Eve&nbsp;
make for themselves aprons of fig leaves right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:04.500
in other words that's the first religious act&nbsp;
religious in the negative sense let's fool God uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:11.760
we know something's wrong okay so all human beings&nbsp;
throughout history have known something is wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:18.000
uh how do we address it well that's what religion&nbsp;
is right we say that there's this gulf between us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.280
and the gods there's this uh break uh how do we&nbsp;
deal with that well that that's what religions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:31.200
purport to do to to somehow repair the breach or&nbsp;
to climb the ladder uh from here to there we know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:37.980
we're not there we need to get there to to Heaven&nbsp;
uh to to some place other than here how do we do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:45.060
that how do we appease the Gods uh how do we lure&nbsp;
the Gods uh into coming to our Aid that's what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:56.160
religion is and in our hearts we we we we we often&nbsp;
do it in a way that there's there's deception&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.620
notice it's like well how do I fool God Adam and&nbsp;
Eve say we're going to cover our nakedness with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:10.020
with with fig leaves now which apparently aren't a&nbsp;
very good covering I talked to Matthew pejo about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:15.660
that and fig leaves turn out to be not exactly&nbsp;
the sort of leaf with any that anyone with any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:21.180
any sense would ever use to cover themselves so&nbsp;
it's a pathetic attempt as well as a deceptive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:28.560
attempt well it's it it I didn't I didn't know&nbsp;
that nor is it relevant but since it's your show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:35.460
we're going to let that ride let me tell you why&nbsp;
the Fig leaves are insufficient God then this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.660
just an amazing thing you've probably seen this&nbsp;
but I'm I'm fascinated by this that in the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:47.820
few verses of Genesis it shows Adam and Eve doing&nbsp;
something to sort of fool God they know something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:52.320
is wrong because For the First Time Of course&nbsp;
something is wrong they're no longer Walking with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:52.320 --> 00:50:00.480
God and they're they've broken the relationship&nbsp;
with God and they try to do something about it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:08.400
God deems what they have done insufficient and it&nbsp;
says he makes for them animal skins in other words&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:17.580
blood had to be shed innocent animals had to be&nbsp;
killed and blood had to be shed in order that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:26.940
could be covered which is of course a prefiguring&nbsp;
of the sacrifice and the death of Jesus blood has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:34.560
to be shed you think you can cover these mistakes&nbsp;
on your own with these little religious acts and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:39.840
things and God says no no you don't understand&nbsp;
the depth of the horror blood innocent blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:47.580
has to be shed to cover what you have done and&nbsp;
of course when you refer to Cain and Abel it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:52.200
the same kind of thing I'm trying to do I'm trying&nbsp;
to do this and this this and God and God says no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:57.960
this is what's required right it has to be a real&nbsp;
sacrifice that's able sacrifice crisis right and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:05.340
there are also sacrifices that involve blood so&nbsp;
imagine where we are to today that you have people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:12.420
um I mean they've effectively created a false&nbsp;
religion which is particularly horrifying and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:18.240
wicked uh it's it's almost like a you know&nbsp;
we're we're seeing it now with the with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:25.020
with the sheer lunacy of the The Pride uh&nbsp;
Juggernaut you know that everybody has to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:30.780
be bullied into agreeing with what whatever&nbsp;
it is and not agree but it's celebrating and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:37.680
worshiping yes if you don't say Heil Hitler&nbsp;
loud enough people will look at you funny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:44.340
um why you you seem to say Heil Hitler with&nbsp;
some trepidation Perhaps Perhaps you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:51.540
like the fuhrer uh you know in other words&nbsp;
if if you don't heartily express uh Your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:57.600
Enthusiasm and approval of X Y and Z people&nbsp;
look at you funny and so if you don't have any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:04.680
um connection to God or to truth or to reality&nbsp;
then you you look around and go oh what what do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.580
I need to do so that people won't look at me&nbsp;
funny so that I might not lose my job or lose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:13.920
my friends what do I need to do what do I need&nbsp;
to post on social media what what how do I need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:23.220
to uh you know out before what do I have to not&nbsp;
say and so that's again you know you see this all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:29.640
through history uh but the reason I wrote letter&nbsp;
to the American church is because you know it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:37.320
my thesis that Christians have no excuse uh&nbsp;
in this you claim to believe in the ground of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:42.060
all being you claim to believe in the god of the&nbsp;
Bible that he you know not just died for you but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:48.540
literally bodily rose from the dead and defeated&nbsp;
to death if you believe that which you claim to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:58.140
you will behave differently you will behave&nbsp;
fearlessly as Martyrs and others have throughout&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:02.400
the centuries that's what's required of us&nbsp;
and we've been kind of drifting along with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:06.300
everything you know pretty fine we kind of&nbsp;
thought like well we don't we don't actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:11.160
have to give our lives or or maybe lose our&nbsp;
jobs or whatever you have a lot of pastors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:19.140
um you know to put this even uh more pointedly&nbsp;
who they're worried about maybe losing their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:26.340
501c3 tax deductible status by saying something&nbsp;
vaguely political from the pulpit and I thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:32.760
what kind of cowards can you be you're supposed&nbsp;
to be speaking truth you're supposed to care about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.440
people out there not just in your congregation but&nbsp;
out there in the world so that if you were alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:43.320
in slavery times you would be speaking against&nbsp;
this satanic abomination of the slave trade as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:49.740
Wilberforce did uh and against slavery as people&nbsp;
did and when people say oh you're being political&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:54.480
just stick to theology you say excuse me what&nbsp;
kind of theology do I have what kind of gospel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:54.480 --> 00:54:01.140
am I preaching if I don't care about people&nbsp;
who are suffering Horrors if I if I'm silent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.720
everyone's talking about how chat GPT and&nbsp;
artificial intelligence are going to change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:12.000
the world Microsoft and Google are investing&nbsp;
heavily in AI they're also the same big tech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.220
companies that determine your search results only&nbsp;
now they get to cut out a whole new layer from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:23.340
information you see that's why I use expressvpn&nbsp;
to add that layer of protection back between me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:29.880
and big Tech the expressvpn app hides your unique&nbsp;
IP address on all of your devices this makes it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:35.880
much more difficult for big Tech to identify who&nbsp;
you are expressvpn is so easy to use all I have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:41.640
do is tap one button on my phone or computer to&nbsp;
turn it on and that's it but expressvpn doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:47.700
just protect me from Big Tech it also encrypts&nbsp;
100 of my online traffic keeping me safe from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:53.520
hackers and prying eyes and the best part is one&nbsp;
expressvpn subscription covers up to five devices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:53.520 --> 00:55:00.120
at the same time so stop letting big Tech Leach&nbsp;
onto your data freely by visiting expressvpn.com&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:11.100
Jordan that's exp r e s s vpn.com Jordan and get&nbsp;
three extra months free if expressvpn.com Jordan

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:23.520
in Canada and I burst onto the scene I supposed&nbsp;
to speak so to speak in 2016 it was on this trans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:29.340
issue peripherally but for me it was the&nbsp;
government was mandating a certain form of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:34.140
speech right the government said well here's the&nbsp;
words you have to use and I thought there's no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:38.400
goddamn way I'm letting you bikers take control&nbsp;
of my tongue because I know what happens when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:43.320
that happens and what happens is everyone ends up&nbsp;
in hell and although it's sort of like hell being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:48.180
in Trudeau's Canada it's not as bad as it could&nbsp;
get but it'll certainly get there if everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:54.600
holds their tongue when they have something to say&nbsp;
I've been reading Jonah so here's something cool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:59.040
right and you tell me what you think about this&nbsp;
it's sort of like the Cain and Abel situation so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:04.320
God comes to Jonah and says well you got some&nbsp;
things to say there buddy get yourself to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:09.600
city and make some noise and Jonah being a very&nbsp;
wise man thinks up yours God I'm going the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:16.260
direction like anyone sensible would right right&nbsp;
and so he jumps on a boat right and away he goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:22.080
but the storms rise eyes and he admits his sins&nbsp;
and the sailors throw him overboard and then you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:27.060
think well that's pretty rough on poor Jonah God&nbsp;
told him to SPO to speak and he was silent now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:31.440
he's going to drown and then you'd read and you&nbsp;
think oh well drowning would have been real good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:36.240
for Jonah because the next thing that happens is&nbsp;
the worst possible Creature from the darkness of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:42.240
the Abyss comes up and pulls him to the bottom of&nbsp;
reality itself where he cooks away for three days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:47.160
and so you don't just end up in the damn water&nbsp;
you end up in hell if you shut your mouth when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:53.520
you have something to say you've just given it&nbsp;
a vaguely jungian gloss which I will pretend not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:53.520 --> 00:57:04.980
to notice um honestly uh these stories I mean&nbsp;
I don't know how to respond except to say yes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:13.920
uh again wonderful exegesis and look these&nbsp;
stories which are from sacred scripture are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:26.160
their uh they're fathomless you know the meaning&nbsp;
truth I mean it just uh it's I I run a series&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:35.280
um a conversation series called Socrates in the&nbsp;
city um and the idea is Socrates uh you know being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:40.560
Greek I had to uh name in soccer season City but&nbsp;
Socrates said the unexamined life is not worth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:47.220
living now he was not a Christian but he had the&nbsp;
good sense to believe that there's probably this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:55.140
thing called Truth we could probably arrive at it&nbsp;
by asking questions and honestly trying to answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:05.040
the questions and that again there's a pre&nbsp;
supposition that that Socrates has and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:09.900
says it's worth risking and it's worth examining&nbsp;
Our Lives when he says the unexamined life is is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:16.800
not worth living and I think you know you have&nbsp;
to be a particularly fearful shallow person to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:22.800
say I don't have time for that I just want to&nbsp;
get by tell me what I need to do how many Jews&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:28.860
do I need to kill how many blacks do do I need&nbsp;
to enslave like you tell me what I need to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:33.240
oh do I need to say this oh no now today I need&nbsp;
to say the opposite of that just tell me what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:39.300
in other words the idea that you would you know&nbsp;
sell your soul for a mess of pottage to go back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:47.160
to your Cain and Abel reference it's an amazing&nbsp;
thing and I I think if we're honest we know we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:52.620
are all guilty of that to some extent but to the&nbsp;
extent that you are aware of your guilt you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:52.620 --> 00:59:02.040
to wake up others and that's what I I'm hoping&nbsp;
to do is to say folks those of you who claim to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:07.020
be Christian this is again I I write all of my&nbsp;
books for everyone and I can make the case for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:11.340
why I believe in the Christian faith but I'm&nbsp;
talking in this last book led to the American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:15.900
Church specifically to those who already claim to&nbsp;
believe this and I say listen if you believe this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:24.180
you're on the hook for for actually leading the&nbsp;
way in leading in in in leading the way in showing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:32.040
people what courage looks like in showing people&nbsp;
that no no there is this thing called Truth and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:41.100
are made uh to speak truth and to act truth and we&nbsp;
believe that you know what even if I lose my life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:47.340
I don't lose my life but you know Bonhoeffer uh&nbsp;
famously when he was being led to the Gallows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:53.880
you know he he knew that he says you know this is&nbsp;
this is the end but for me the beginning of Life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:54.480 --> 01:00:03.360
if you know that Jesus has risen from the dead you&nbsp;
know that this is not all there is you're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:12.540
live dramatically differently than someone who's&nbsp;
scared to death of dying um and so what I'm saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:17.460
to those who claim to be Christians today is you&nbsp;
ought to be leading the way you pastors ought to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:24.780
be shouting this from your pulpits fearlessly all&nbsp;
of these lies uh all of these efforts to silence&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:32.160
us are satanic and by the way they are harming&nbsp;
human beings just as the Silence of the Pastors in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:39.420
Germany led to the uh you mean double mastectomies&nbsp;
you mean those human beings that is one&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:46.920
prominent example if you care about them and by&nbsp;
the way God commands us to care about them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:53.700
to love them then you will speak up for them if&nbsp;
you don't you're not loving them and God judges&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:59.820
you as guilty and he will hold you to account&nbsp;
because you claim to Believe In The God Who says&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:04.860
you're supposed to care about them so that's&nbsp;
one issue one very dramatic you know there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:12.900
also there's a a line I was just writing about&nbsp;
this the other day about stripes and so Christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:19.020
says if you do not know and you transgress it's&nbsp;
something like that you will be punished with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:24.360
certain burden of Stripes but if you know and you&nbsp;
sin then you will be punished much more harshly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:29.040
and this is the situation the Christians you're&nbsp;
addressing actually should find themselves in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:33.600
because they've already made this claim to know&nbsp;
right they've already made this claim to Faith&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.580
and are attempting to accrue the status that goes&nbsp;
along with that and some of them actually do know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:45.060
you know that they need to tell the truth or else&nbsp;
and the the notion there is that if you do already&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:52.500
know that and you still lie um you're going to be&nbsp;
punished much more harshly than those who lie who&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:57.600
are also ignorant and I believe that's also true I&nbsp;
certainly saw that my clinical practice if because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:03.600
it's partly because if you lie there's a sin there&nbsp;
obviously because you go off the path but if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:09.060
know you're lying and you're transgressing against&nbsp;
your own moral code then not only are you lying in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:14.340
the moment but you're betraying your innermost&nbsp;
self right you're betraying your ultimate core&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:19.920
in the most real sense and you are absolutely 100&nbsp;
percent going to pay for that and so is everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:25.140
around you this is what verified me I want to&nbsp;
ask you why you became a Christian like what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:31.920
terrifies me into religious submission it just&nbsp;
seem like this thing yeah okay well you went&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.700
to Yale and you're in the English Department&nbsp;
and that was before you had a conversion what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:42.960
happened to you what happened in the conversion&nbsp;
and why did you switch your tune laughs that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.520
the funniest way of putting it that I've ever&nbsp;
heard thank you for that why did I switch my tune&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:54.300
um yeah I was you know I was raised in the&nbsp;
Greek Orthodox church and I had a vague Faith&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:55.140 --> 01:03:02.100
um at Yale which is extraordinarily was then&nbsp;
and of course is now dramatically more secular&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:10.200
hostile to genuine biblical Faith um hostile&nbsp;
to uh the ideas the American ideas of freedom&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:19.320
and so on and so forth I uh you know foolishly&nbsp;
drank that Kool-Aid and drifted into um genuine&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:27.720
agnosticism and I was dramatically lost I was&nbsp;
really um you know I wasn't some proud atheistic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:34.920
sinner I was just lost uh and um ultimately&nbsp;
we could talk about this later but ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:43.080
um I found myself horror of Horrors moving back in&nbsp;
with my parents my European immigrant uh parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:48.180
who had worked menial jobs to put me through Yale&nbsp;
University and they're kind of looking at me like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:54.780
so why are you back here again what are you doing&nbsp;
here but I was totally lost and in that season of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:54.780 --> 01:04:02.760
my life I was 24 I got this horrible menial job&nbsp;
uh as a proofreader at Union Carbide in Danbury&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:12.420
Connecticut the uh the Hebrew word is gehenna it&nbsp;
was awful and and in that misery I met someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:18.420
who began to share his faith with me and I was&nbsp;
initially hostile or at least not wanting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:28.860
hear it uh for for many many months and long story&nbsp;
short around my 25th birthday uh I had a dramatic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:40.980
miraculous dream uh in which in a nutshell God&nbsp;
spoke to me so unequivocally that there was no&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:47.160
going back it was game over I say it's like&nbsp;
going to sleep single and waking up married&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:47.880 --> 01:05:01.140
would you tell me the dream now sure um it's it's&nbsp;
actually hard to do justice to it um it it uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:10.260
it it encompasses three parts of my life part&nbsp;
of the reason it was so staggering to me as&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:15.420
I was having this dream because I don't I don't&nbsp;
dream very much and I had never ever had a dream&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:20.520
anything like this this was a this was another&nbsp;
category of dream it was like having a vision&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:25.200
in the context of a dream I was&nbsp;
unconscious of course I was sleeping but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:33.060
um I have to say a couple of things for the for&nbsp;
background so you get the vocabulary number one&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:43.500
grew up uh as the son of immigrants my father&nbsp;
from Greece uh you know very like most Greeks&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:50.280
inordinately proud of being Greek and wanting&nbsp;
to uh raise his kids in in that tradition and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:57.720
so that was a very important part of my growing up&nbsp;
that I am Greek that I uh this is my my identity&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:05.820
um once uh my father uh we were at a light I&nbsp;
mean I I I I I still drive there today and at&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:09.780
this light we saw the car in front of us on the&nbsp;
bumper that had one of those you know Chrome fish&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:15.480
this is in the 70s and my father says do you&nbsp;
know what that is and he explains to me that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:24.960
that's the Greek word for the Greek word for&nbsp;
fish uh is is um is ichthys and it's spelled&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:31.740
um you know it's an acronym well the word is&nbsp;
ichthys so but the early Christians adopted&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:37.500
that symbol of the fish as a symbol of the&nbsp;
Christian faith because the word fish is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:46.620
acronym for isus Christos Theos Iman sotir Jesus&nbsp;
Christ the son of God our savior so they use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:50.760
symbol of the fish because to them the symbol&nbsp;
of the fish meant ichthys Jesus Christ the son&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:54.900
of God our savior so it's the secret symbol of the&nbsp;
Christians and my father was you know thrilled to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:54.900 --> 01:07:00.540
tell me that's a Greek word and that's where that&nbsp;
comes from uh and so I always Associated that fish&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:05.700
with with Christ after I saw that so again it's&nbsp;
by way of background fishing was very important&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:11.580
to me growing up also I should say that you know&nbsp;
if I had a hobby other than like watching sitcoms&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:18.060
um it was uh it was fishing that was very&nbsp;
important to me so you like so all things up from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:25.560
the depths don't get young in on me you do that&nbsp;
on your own time okay so so yeah yeah of course so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:34.080
um basically uh around this 25th birthday if you&nbsp;
said who are you you know in your guts it was well&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:41.880
the Greek background and my family was vitally&nbsp;
Central to who I was secondly this idea of fishing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:48.120
this was this was my main my only hobby the thing&nbsp;
that I did when I when I had time but thirdly the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:53.040
life of the mind when I went to Yale suddenly I&nbsp;
cared about the meaning of life and I really was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:59.220
an English major I realized even somewhat at the&nbsp;
time because I'm trying to figure out the nature&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:04.320
of Reality by reading these great novels in the&nbsp;
western Canon I'm putting together these pieces to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:08.700
figure out what is the nature of reality what is&nbsp;
the meaning of life and I was actually doing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:14.040
uh without doing it particularly intentionally&nbsp;
it was just instinctively the life of the mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:17.820
um and I came up and I have to say&nbsp;
this so then the dream will make sense&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:25.920
I came up with um you know as only a&nbsp;
pretentious undergraduate could do I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:30.900
I think I've I've got to figure it out uh&nbsp;
that uh it's it's kind of like a literary&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:38.760
Trope it's an image of of a frozen lake uh and&nbsp;
what all religions world religions mean to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:44.880
is so this is where it becomes Freudian&nbsp;
and jungian and you must forgive me but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:50.520
the idea of a Frozen like I thought this is a&nbsp;
perfect image for what religion tries to do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:57.240
have this ice on the top of the lake which is like&nbsp;
the conscious mind the ice is the conscious mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:06.780
and our goal is to drill through the ice to touch&nbsp;
the water which is the collective unconscious we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:12.660
want to touch the Divinity the godhead again&nbsp;
Jung's idea not the Bible's idea but but this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:19.740
idea that uh that's what God is the collective&nbsp;
unconscious so I had this image that I developed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:23.040
you know as an undergraduate like okay so that's&nbsp;
what all religions are trying to do they're trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:27.960
to drill through the conscious mind to touch the&nbsp;
other side to touch the collective unconscious&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:33.600
which is the kind of new age idea of the Divinity&nbsp;
the godhead whatever that is so I I bring all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:39.780
of this you know into my 24th year and around&nbsp;
my 25th birthday have this dream in the dream&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:46.620
I'm standing on a frozen lake Candlewood Lake in&nbsp;
Danbury Connecticut I'm ice fishing with friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:54.420
and I look at the whole in the ice and I see what&nbsp;
you never see if you're ice fishing I see a fish&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:54.420 --> 01:10:00.960
pointing its snout out of the hole and I look&nbsp;
at it and I reach down and I lifted up by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:05.940
Gill because it was a a pickle or a pike they&nbsp;
have very sharp teeth and you'd never lipland a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:13.620
fish like that so I I pick it up and in the dream&nbsp;
I lift it up and it's a large uh pickerel or Pike&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:19.740
and anybody who knows that fish knows&nbsp;
that it has a kind of bronze coloring but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:27.840
on that glorious winter day the Sun was&nbsp;
shining brightly the sky couldn't be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:34.500
Bluer the ice and the snow couldn't have been&nbsp;
whiter and I hold up this fish in the dream&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:42.600
and I see that because of the sun it looks&nbsp;
golden and suddenly in the dream I realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:50.160
no it it doesn't just look golden it is&nbsp;
golden it is a golden fish made of gold&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:56.700
like in a fairy tale but it is alive a living&nbsp;
golden fish and in that moment in the dream

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:03.660
God effectively drops this into&nbsp;
my head like in paragraphs I knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:13.680
this is God saying to me in this dream you want&nbsp;
it to drill through the ice to touch inert water&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:19.740
to touch the collective unconscious the Divinity&nbsp;
that God had I have something else for you I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:29.580
the golden fish ichthys Jesus Christ my son your&nbsp;
savior Jesus Christ how did you know that why&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:34.800
did you make the association between the fish&nbsp;
specifically at that point in Christ what did&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:41.520
that happen in the dream no that's what I'm saying&nbsp;
it happened in the dream I knew but in realization&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:48.120
took place in the dream too the realization took&nbsp;
place within the Dream Within the dream I knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:55.440
within the dream that this is Jesus Christ the&nbsp;
son of God our savior I had been searching for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:00.060
this thing this for to touch in earth water&nbsp;
and God says I'd like to uh I'd like to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.340
um one-up you with your own symbol system I'd&nbsp;
like to give you what you're really looking for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:11.580
my son your savior Jesus Christ a living being&nbsp;
and when you think about it theologically a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:18.060
fish coming out of water what is what happens&nbsp;
when a fish comes out of the water it dies um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:28.380
the idea that God came from his medium to our&nbsp;
medium to die um all of this came clear in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:34.680
dream and when I was in the dream holding this&nbsp;
fish I was flooded with joy because what I had&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:42.540
believed you could not know that that the Bible is&nbsp;
true that Jesus is God in the dream I realized no&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:51.300
I I know and as I was holding the fish I realized&nbsp;
I I I I have I have what I'm looking for what I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:58.080
was looking for which I didn't believe could be&nbsp;
found I this is God he's given himself to me and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:02.940
in the dream I was flooded with joy within the&nbsp;
dream before I woke up I knew this is true and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:08.160
I just had this choice so the next day I went and&nbsp;
I told the friend of mine at work the story I said&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:14.280
I had this dream and he says what do you think it&nbsp;
means and I said and I never would have said these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:21.060
words these words would have made me cringe at any&nbsp;
previous day I said it means I've accepted Jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:29.880
I never would have said that I I Was Made&nbsp;
uncomfortable by people who said that but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:36.240
uh I knew that I had jumped over the&nbsp;
broomstick uh that I was in another&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:42.060
world that I had accepted Jesus and that's you&nbsp;
know that happened right around my 25th birthday

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:49.200
what happened well that's a great Dream by the&nbsp;
way I mean that's that's quite the archetypal&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:55.080
blast you got there that'll that'll thank you to&nbsp;
fish around in the dark yeah you never know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:01.800
you're going to catch yeah I really feel like I'm&nbsp;
talking about Jordan Peterson uh it's it's so yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.460
it changes everything I mean I was a different&nbsp;
person from that day forward my life changed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:13.440
very dramatically how are you different how are&nbsp;
you different what changed about you well the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:20.160
first uh most immediate uh embar uh somewhat&nbsp;
embarrassing manifestation is I immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:26.340
stopped sleeping with my girlfriend of three&nbsp;
years I knew I I can't do that that's for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:36.060
marriage and I uh I I want God so that's the&nbsp;
sacrifice well yes and no in the sense that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:44.820
you know people often say that you you know God&nbsp;
always out gives you that whatever you give up for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:51.240
him is nothing compared to what he gives you and&nbsp;
I had such a sense of his presence in those first&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:58.320
days of my conversion that I thought I wouldn't&nbsp;
give that up for anything I wouldn't do anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:04.920
to hinder that that personal relationship with&nbsp;
the God who loves me and died for me and created&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:10.980
the universe that it it was so beautiful and&nbsp;
extraordinary that you you wouldn't do anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:17.640
to screw that up you you just know that that's not&nbsp;
about anything well I mean and again but I have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:25.020
be real clear again I was unconscious during this&nbsp;
dream this wasn't like I reasoned my way to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:29.220
and I could take any credit or particular pride&nbsp;
this happened to me so this is the definition&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:35.460
of a gift from God uh I I knew it was a gift&nbsp;
from from from God and and I just thought I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:41.460
don't wanna I don't want to screw that up right&nbsp;
right so how did you change in your behavior you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:44.760
said you stopped sleeping with your girlfriend&nbsp;
and so is that not good enough for you Jordan&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:53.640
yeah that's pretty dramatic that was pretty that&nbsp;
was pretty dramatic for me at age time I suspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:53.640 --> 01:16:03.000
for your girlfriend too well yes of course that's&nbsp;
that's the thing is is that uh you know we when&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.120
you choose God you don't know where that's going&nbsp;
to lead you uh but it really that's the fun of it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.360
well that's that's correct that is the fun of&nbsp;
it because God that's the abrahamic adventure eh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:24.960
whom we can trust wants to take us on a glorious&nbsp;
Adventure he invites us to this glorious adventure&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:31.260
and when you turn it down you think you're turning&nbsp;
down some kind of bummer and it's like no you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:39.000
don't understand this is what you were made for&nbsp;
this is the adventure of your of your life it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:45.960
uh what's the Pink Floyd line you know and did you&nbsp;
trade a walking a walk-on part in the war for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:56.040
lead role in a cage you you're being given uh a&nbsp;
role in in the battle between good and evil which&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:04.800
is real God says come with me on this adventure&nbsp;
participate with me in in in this extraordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:11.400
Adventure you've been given the privilege to to&nbsp;
be on the side of good and Truth in this in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:17.700
war and you know you follow uh my banner and you&nbsp;
walk with me and this is what you were created&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:24.840
for and imagine saying no no I want to be the&nbsp;
star of my own show uh you know I want I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:29.760
to I Wanna I wanna I want the lead role but you&nbsp;
know as Pink Floyd says lead role in Sex in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:36.240
City it's well actually it's it's miltonic right&nbsp;
I mean you know I I'd rather reign in Hell than&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:45.480
serve in heaven what could be more foolish than&nbsp;
that nothing yeah right right absolutely well that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:50.520
that's that's what I think about Power claims too&nbsp;
it's like because people will say well people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:57.540
use power are successful and I think well if&nbsp;
you're ruling over hell and are you the least&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:02.340
successful are you the most successful or the&nbsp;
least successful and it seems to me that the ruler&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:07.440
of hell is actually the least successful person&nbsp;
in hell and that's where you get if you use power&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:12.720
so you might be able to rule but it'll be hell and&nbsp;
you think you're the winner but you're actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:19.200
the ultimate loser it's it's actually painful to&nbsp;
contemplate I mean genuinely yes well that's why&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.580
you should contemplate it that's exactly right&nbsp;
you know I tried to learn the lesson of the of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:29.280
the Holocaust because that's what we're enjoined&nbsp;
upon to do right never forget well that means&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:34.500
understand and that means while figuring out how&nbsp;
you take those first steps to hell and then the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:39.240
next steps and then the next steps and then drag&nbsp;
everyone along with you and you definitely do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:47.400
by lying there's no doubt about that well I mean I&nbsp;
became the what you're saying you know the the my&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:54.180
Bonhoeffer book which uh you know it's it's it's&nbsp;
it's a 600 Page biography of a German Pastor who&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:54.900 --> 01:19:02.580
saw these things happening and knew that he must&nbsp;
speak out against it and he tried to wake up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:08.640
church because he knew that God specifically&nbsp;
called the church to be the conscience of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:15.420
state you claim to believe this and this and this&nbsp;
and this you must stand against this evil and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:23.040
we know what happened so the idea that all these&nbsp;
years later something similar could be happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:27.840
and how many people have said you know we never&nbsp;
we're never going to repeat that again never gonna&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:34.560
and you ask the question okay how are you going&nbsp;
to prevent it did you learn the lessons did you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.060
learn that there is such a thing as satanic evil&nbsp;
when you look at the Death Grips I mean listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:48.360
that's the question isn't that the question they&nbsp;
uncovered the death camps I think most people in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:54.840
the world couldn't believe it it was too horrible&nbsp;
it was too horrible there's something inside us&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:54.840 --> 01:20:02.040
that says I I can't take that in and I think&nbsp;
that's what we're facing today uh when Naomi&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:10.020
wolf you know dug into the Pfizer documents and&nbsp;
you look at the evil it's it's too much to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:19.200
in it will change you when you see the evil uh&nbsp;
of of the the the Chinese Communist party's Will&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:25.980
To Power it's painful to look at and yet we must&nbsp;
look at it we must deal with it we must ask what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:34.080
what is the answer uh for us what what are we to&nbsp;
do you know you have to respond you cannot look&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:40.200
the other way but the temptation to look the other&nbsp;
way is dramatically strong and that's what I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:48.060
people like you and I are hoping to do is to to&nbsp;
tell people no no God is with you in this don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:53.940
be afraid yeah yeah well you can be more you can&nbsp;
even be more pessimistic about it in some ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:59.400
you know you can tell people well it's going to be&nbsp;
pretty damn brutal if you tell the truth but boy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:05.280
you want brutal you just keep lying and see where&nbsp;
you end up that'll be brutal Beyond Your Wildest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:11.820
imaginings man that's absolutely 100 percent for&nbsp;
sure in the course of writing that this new book&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:17.280
my shortest book letter to the American church&nbsp;
I came to the conclusion that as horrific as it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:22.620
is to think about what the Silence of the German&nbsp;
Church led to the Silence of the American church&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:30.480
now if we do not repent and begin to speak&nbsp;
out boldly against every one of these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:38.280
the result will be worse even if possible&nbsp;
than what happened in the Holocaust yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:44.220
well we're more powerful now so why not think&nbsp;
about the whole 20th century as a trial run&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:49.860
and there were no wiser obviously because people&nbsp;
are still you know what did they say they still&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:53.820
allow the cat to have their tongue it doesn't&nbsp;
matter if I don't say what I believe to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:58.440
true it's like yeah well you just keep walking&nbsp;
down that road buddy and see where you end up&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:02.580
so hey so what happened what kind of&nbsp;
response did you get from the church&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:07.500
to your book what kind of or what kind of&nbsp;
response are you still getting who's to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:13.440
what the church is but I will tell you that&nbsp;
the response has been um very very positive&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:22.020
um I I'm very happy to say that because I had&nbsp;
no clue I didn't write this book as some career&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:28.320
move or a way to make money I just thought I&nbsp;
have this I must write this but the response&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:38.580
has been extraordinarily positive uh I I am I've&nbsp;
never ever gotten as many speaking invitations uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:44.640
people email emailing us daily we I bought 20&nbsp;
copies to give it to every Pastor in my area I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:49.320
I've been thinking this with the thank you for&nbsp;
saying this and stuff so it's uh in fact later&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:59.340
um next week I'm I'm flying to LA to film a&nbsp;
documentary uh which is this book in in in film&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:06.960
uh form to get the message out to a wider audience&nbsp;
uh because the response has been that dramatic in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:13.020
fact I spoke about this uh at a church uh in in&nbsp;
California some months ago and some people there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:18.600
and who are in Hollywood and they said we've got&nbsp;
to make a documentary film of of what you just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:27.120
said of this book we've got to get this message&nbsp;
out so I can say with cautious optimism that uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:35.040
the the response has been genuinely&nbsp;
um better than I had feared uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:41.700
better than I had hoped even um and I'm I'm&nbsp;
you can understand why I'd be glad to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:46.920
that because I have hope in other words I feel&nbsp;
that there are people joining the battle there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:53.460
are people understanding you know what I got this&nbsp;
wrong and I see that now I was uh you know in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:57.240
early days of covet we shut down our church and&nbsp;
we just did whatever the government told us to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:04.200
do we we'd never seen this before but you're&nbsp;
seeing first of all um wherever I'm invited&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:10.680
to speak it's usually by some heroic pastor and&nbsp;
the story is the same every single time they say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:20.040
our numbers in this church have tripled quadrupled&nbsp;
quintupled because we were Brave in in the early&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:26.220
days of covert we kept our church open and people&nbsp;
are flocking to us because they say those people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:31.140
must know something they they they seem to believe&nbsp;
in Freedom they seem to believe in something and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:37.860
and and those churches have exploded in numbers&nbsp;
the churches that were playing it safe uh are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:49.440
withering when Jesus right that's no church&nbsp;
plays it safe no no absolutely not no the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:55.080
church is a real church is the most dangerous&nbsp;
place you could possibly be well that's right&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:59.880
so that's the safest yeah how weird is that&nbsp;
and I well of course well you know the truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:06.840
is paradoxical well that's just the the nature of&nbsp;
things but I have to say that you know it's kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.400
of like if somebody says to George Washington&nbsp;
in 1776 hey George how do you think it's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:20.040
um you know I'm seated here on the very Island uh&nbsp;
uh well actually across the East River which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:25.080
not a river um from where they had the Battle of&nbsp;
Brooklyn the Battle of Long Island if you'd said&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:31.560
to George Washington in 1776 how's it going how&nbsp;
do you think it's going to go in the natural his&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:38.340
answer would have been we don't know if Providence&nbsp;
before us and we fight with everything we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:44.520
um God may give us the victory but he wouldn't&nbsp;
have said like hey we got this you know it's good&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:52.620
no and that's where we are now we are in a battle&nbsp;
uh for Freedom between good and evil and our job&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:59.340
is to fight our job is to fight and to look to&nbsp;
God for leadership and guidance and the results&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:08.340
are in his hands but the the response to this book&nbsp;
has given me reason uh to hope that we might uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:17.340
fight on and might eventually uh win in some ways&nbsp;
and might eventually uh yeah what would a victory&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:21.840
look like you know I've wrote this on the Russian&nbsp;
Ukraine front but let's talk about it on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:28.320
front Okay so there's a victory all right so what&nbsp;
are you aiming at what's the victory here what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:37.200
that well like compared to what's happening now&nbsp;
the the uh the restoration of uh of this nation&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:46.440
America to um foundational principles uh to the&nbsp;
Constitution the uh the draining of the swamp&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:52.500
that is the Deep State the unelected bureaucrats&nbsp;
who are at war with we the people who are at war&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:58.500
with the freedoms enshrined in our founding&nbsp;
documents uh that would be a big part of it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:08.160
um the the idea that we would again be free that&nbsp;
I would go to a to vote uh and know that my vote&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:16.320
is genuinely counted I wouldn't doubt that um&nbsp;
there are a host of things that would happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:23.580
um our freedom to speak the truth whether it&nbsp;
makes people uncomfortable or doesn't the the our&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:31.740
freedom to question things like is this vaccine a&nbsp;
good idea uh our freedom to question whether there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:38.640
was chicanery uh in that election I mean that's&nbsp;
basic stuff that we have the freedom to question&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:42.420
these things and people can say you're full of&nbsp;
it and we can say okay let's let's debate it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:48.060
let's discuss it let's open the books let's look&nbsp;
into it that's so basic and those again those are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:57.060
foundational principles and uh you know to put it&nbsp;
on a higher plane when Lincoln talked about a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:57.060 --> 01:28:05.880
birth of Freedom uh I think it would look like a&nbsp;
new birth of Freedom uh a re-establishment of uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:14.100
of freedom and of the promises uh you know quoting&nbsp;
Martin Luther King Jr no the the promissory notes&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:21.120
of our founding documents we have yet to live out&nbsp;
a lot of that uh in many ways we've gone backwards&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:28.440
in the last 50 or so years and so the the&nbsp;
bureaucratic deep State the these people that have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:35.940
become authoritarian anti-American anti-freedom&nbsp;
I mean all of that has to be dealt with and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:44.340
um I think that you know we don't know where it's&nbsp;
going to go but not to try uh not to fight and to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:52.260
try and to pray and to to do that is just you&nbsp;
know beyond pathetic it's complicity with evil&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:57.060
uh and you know Bonhoeffer didn't say it probably&nbsp;
but it's often associated with him silence in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:57.060 --> 01:29:04.920
face of evil is itself evil not to speak is to&nbsp;
speak not to act is to act God will not hold us&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:09.720
Guiltless there are many people that think like&nbsp;
I'm just gonna take a a third I'm gonna I'm gonna&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:15.360
be neutral yeah and you think no you know what&nbsp;
Christ says about neutral people in the Book of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:21.540
Revelation right yes that's good Cold's good but&nbsp;
sitting in the middle you better watch the hell&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:27.360
out buddy well it's sort of funny though that&nbsp;
people again this is the parallel phrase no no&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:35.040
he didn't uh but but in Germany this is what a lot&nbsp;
of these religious leaders thought that that well&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:39.360
there's a safe religious path we're just going&nbsp;
to stick to quote unquote preaching the gospel&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:45.540
we don't want to get political we don't want to&nbsp;
speak again and that's when you realize that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:50.340
parable of the talents in the scripture talk talks&nbsp;
about that that that somebody who cynically says&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:56.520
I'm gonna I'm gonna take this Talent I'm gonna I'm&nbsp;
gonna bury it uh that way I can't lose it and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:04.740
like no you don't understand God requires of us&nbsp;
to be all in if you're not all in you're judged&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:09.960
guilty and there are a lot of people that right&nbsp;
now are just wanting to not get involved I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:14.880
want to be divisive I don't want to bring this&nbsp;
stuff up and you realize well God is is is asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:21.240
you just to try to get it right you might not get&nbsp;
it right but you have to try and to not try and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:28.680
to just to cover your rear end uh is ends up being&nbsp;
Wicked because people are going to suffer because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:35.340
of your silence people are going to suffer because&nbsp;
of your inaction your passivity and trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:43.740
paint it uh along some religious lines makes you&nbsp;
even more guilty because you're trying to give&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:49.200
this religious excuse for something that is at war&nbsp;
with God himself with his purposes I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:54.780
bring Eric over to the Daily wire side because we&nbsp;
haven't we're not on the dark side enough yet so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:54.780 --> 01:31:01.140
we might as well go there and uh we're going to&nbsp;
talk a little bit about how his ideas developed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:04.860
how they made themselves manifest across time&nbsp;
we did that a little bit with his description&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:10.860
of his quite remarkable dream and so a few people&nbsp;
who are watching and listening are inclined you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:15.720
might want to head over there it's not such&nbsp;
a bad idea to throw a shackle so to speak the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:21.360
daily wire way at the moment because YouTube has&nbsp;
decided to go to war with us and Them let's say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:27.180
um of course we didn't say anything inflammatory&nbsp;
today so just to maintain the peace can I say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:32.760
something inflammatory one final inflammatory&nbsp;
thing hey man I just I wanna no but just because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:37.800
we we touched on so many things and yet there's so&nbsp;
many things we didn't touch Sean I would like to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:42.960
shamelessly ask people simply to visit my website&nbsp;
which is ericmataxis.com because there's so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:48.060
things that I wanted to say in the course of this&nbsp;
and obviously wasn't able to but it's just my name&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:56.160
if you can spell it it's Greek Eric mataxis.com&nbsp;
but I just um talking to you Dr Peterson you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:02.340
it's such a joy because there's so many directions&nbsp;
that we can go in and so many directions that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:08.340
did we didn't get to go in but these things are&nbsp;
important these are all profoundly important&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:14.520

to you from the bottom of my heart for being&nbsp;&nbsp;
