00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.000
I think actually that people are quite hard on themselves and, you know,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.260
this is one of the reasons that I believe that the presumption of innocence

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.160
that characterizes our legal system is such an absolute bloody miracle. I cannot figure out

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.920
how in the world that idea ever came about and

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.060
developed universal acceptance.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.860
It's so unlikely, you know. If you deal with people in a clinical setting and they're

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.620
somewhat depressed, which is not uncommon,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.800
and they've done something that they are guilty about.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.340
Independent of whether they've done something that they FEEL guilty about

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.280
independent of whether they're actually guilty,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.540
they tend to take themselves apart.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:54.240
Now, that's especially true if you happen to be high in trait neuroticism, which is one of the big five traits.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.140
Extraversion which is a positive emotion dimension;

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.480
Neuroticism - a negative emotion dimension; agreeableness, which is compassion and politeness.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.560
Conscientiousness, which is orderliness and industrious; and openness which is intellect

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.960
and openness proper something like creativity. If you're higher than normal in neuroticism

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.610
it's very easy to take yourself apart

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.009
if you're feeling guilty about something that you've done. And people, many people,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.540
will feel guilty about what they've done at the drop of a hat. I mean first of all they accuse

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.700
themselves of their own shortcomings

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.620
and then if they are accused by someone else it's often very, very difficult for them to mount their own defense.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.300
You know to believe in their own innocence. You know, because you'd think well,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.000
you know, the police come to your door or a mob comes for you, let's say, on Twitter and you know you're

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.520
stalwart sort of person and you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.360
pronounce your

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.020
innocence and you know, you're a brick wall nothing gets th rough that.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.860
And that's just not how it goes, man. If the mob comes for you on Twitter

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.100
the probability that if you're a reasonably well

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.920
socialized person that you're going to be wondering what you did wrong and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.740
how you should apologize and what you should do to put yourself back in the good graces of the community is

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.600
extraordinarily high.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.629
You know because, well, you probably have done some things wrong in your life and you probably are

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.890
guilty about this and that and perhaps you didn't conduct yourself perfectly.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.040
And so, it's very difficult for you to mount your own

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.400
defense to presume your own innocence and mount your own defense. Which, by the way, is

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.200
why it's a very good reason to have a lawyer and one of the things I would say

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.640
I'm dead serious about this. I've worked with legal cases a lot and learned a lot about the limitations and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.840
lack thereof of

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.829
police ability to question you for example and...

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.370
If you're ever

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.560
accused of something serious

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.320
then do not talk to the police until you have a lawyer.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.960
Because you will definitely get yourself in all sorts of trouble.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.040
And so you might think well if you're innocent and the police will tell you this, too -

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.680
then you have nothing to be afraid of. Of course that's complete bloody rubbish because

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.560
you always have something to be afraid of

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.480
and innocence and guilt are relative things and they're not that easy to determine so

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.140
don't be so sure that you can defend yourself

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.040
especially for reasons we'll go into, but also don't be so sure that you don't need someone who's

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.180
professional to stand sort of outside of you and to look at you like an individual among other

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.360
individuals and to adjudicate your

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.320
relative guilt or innocence in that manner. You know, in our legal system

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.280
you're actually not required to be perfect. And thank God for that.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.600
What you're required to be is reasonable and

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:17.860
like a reasonable and let's say somewhat normative human being. You're not required to go above and beyond the duty with regards to heroism for example.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.580
I was involved in a court case,

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.200
it was quite a terrible case where a woman was up on trial for murder and

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.240
she happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, shall we say. She was in a

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.920
motorhome in a junkyard waiting for her boyfriend and

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.520
she happened to walk out of the motor home just as a gang was killing

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.400
an enemy, I guess an enemy gang member with a

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.989
with rocks very very brutal. And they stripped her naked and told her that they would rape her and that they would kill her child,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.039
she had one child, unless she participated in the murder.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.080
And so, she did and she ended up dropping a rock on the unfortunate

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.520
gentleman's head. Although by all appearances he was

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.339
well on the way to being dead at that point. And at that point in Canada, the law was

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.049
there was no excuse for participating in homicide regardless of the...

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.080
what would you call?

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.620
Ameliorating preconditions. But they did decrease her culpability

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.640
substantially because they believed there was genuine reason for her to

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.220
believe that her life was threatened and that

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.000
she was going to be subjected to sexual assault and that her child,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.880
I don't think they did threaten her child, but they did certainly threaten her child with no longer having a mother.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.400
So...

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.800
In any case, we can get involved in very terrible things and it's very difficult for us to defend ourselves,

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.960
you need a lawyer to do that and

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.000
So that's a good piece of practical advice and I would

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.360
strongly recommend that you follow it if you ever happen to find yourself in trouble.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.260
It's also the case if you find yourself in trouble at work

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.360
or on social media, you know.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.440
It's hard to sit and remind yourself that you deserve

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.860
the benefit of the doubt and then to try to make a coherent case for that.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.500
One of the things I often did for my clients

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.190
who were in trouble at work for one reason or another.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.930
Often because

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.970
well, for a variety of reasons. Sometimes because they hadn't done everything

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.740
they should have that work and so they carried some burden of responsibility for that.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.120
But sometimes because there were people who were genuinely malevolently

00:06:48.120 --> 00:07:02.880
predisposed towards them bullying them in terrible ways. And they just weren't good at mounting their own defense. Which was also one of the things by the way that made them prone to being bullied. And so we would work for hours on

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.160
at least hypothetically outlining a

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.020
story that involved the

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:17.400
possibility that the person who is being accused, so that would be my client, was actually innocent of the charges.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.200
You know, and that's that's something that's useful to do for yourself if you ever run into trouble.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:29.840
It's you don't have to believe that you're innocent to begin with but you could make the strongest case possible

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:36.900
that you are. Right? Because everyone's entitled to a strong defense. And then just see how that flies

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.240
you know, see if it's coherent.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:45.080
I mean you could make the opposite case too  - just so you know what you might be in for, but you know,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.160
we have an adversarial system

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.260
for a reason and part of the reason is that one of the easiest ways to get at the truth,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.340
insofar as that's possible and that's not an easy thing, is to attack

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.680
you know with a certain degree of

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.940
intensity and viciousness and

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.380
defend with a certain degree of

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:10.380
intractability and coherence. And you need both of those.
