can push and anger definitely so
psychophysiologically<00:09:54.640><c> so</c><00:09:54.880><c> imagine</c><00:09:55.279><c> that</c>

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
psychophysiologically so imagine that
 

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.150 align:start position:0%
psychophysiologically so imagine that
this<00:09:56.160><c> is</c><00:09:56.640><c> obviously</c><00:09:57.120><c> a</c><00:09:57.200><c> thought</c><00:09:57.440><c> experiment</c>

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
this is obviously a thought experiment

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
a cat well the reason for that is that
 

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
a cat well the reason for that is that
fear<00:10:10.240><c> will</c><00:10:10.560><c> facilitate</c><00:10:11.200><c> either</c><00:10:11.440><c> freezing</c><00:10:11.839><c> or</c>

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
escape right but sometimes fear isn't
 

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.550 align:start position:0%
escape right but sometimes fear isn't
the<00:10:14.560><c> right</c><00:10:14.800><c> response</c><00:10:15.519><c> and</c><00:10:15.839><c> anger</c><00:10:16.320><c> will</c>

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
the right response and anger will
 

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.030 align:start position:0%
the right response and anger will
