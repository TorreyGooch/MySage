the<00:07:43.039><c> cricket</c><00:07:43.360><c> has</c><00:07:43.599><c> things</c><00:07:43.759><c> to</c><00:07:43.919><c> learn</c><00:07:44.160><c> just</c>

00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
the cricket has things to learn just
 

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:45.670 align:start position:0%
the cricket has things to learn just
like<00:07:44.479><c> pinocchio</c>

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
like pinocchio
 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.990 align:start position:0%
like pinocchio
and<00:07:45.840><c> so</c><00:07:46.000><c> that's</c><00:07:46.240><c> very</c><00:07:46.479><c> cool</c><00:07:46.800><c> because</c><00:07:47.520><c> it's</c><00:07:47.759><c> so</c>

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so that's very cool because it's so
 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.589 align:start position:0%
and so that's very cool because it's so

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
cool it's so sophisticated because it
 

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:51.189 align:start position:0%
cool it's so sophisticated because it
means<00:07:49.840><c> that</c><00:07:49.919><c> you</c><00:07:50.080><c> do</c><00:07:50.240><c> have</c><00:07:50.400><c> a</c><00:07:50.479><c> conscience</c><00:07:50.960><c> that</c>

00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
you have to establish a conscious

you have to establish a conscious

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.469 align:start position:0%

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
you from being a marionette of forces
 

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:10.390 align:start position:0%
you from being a marionette of forces
that<00:08:08.560><c> would</c><00:08:08.720><c> make</c><00:08:08.960><c> you</c><00:08:09.199><c> a</c><00:08:09.360><c> braying</c><00:08:09.840><c> donkey</c><00:08:10.240><c> who</c>

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
that would make you a braying donkey who
 

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.150 align:start position:0%
that would make you a braying donkey who
does<00:08:10.639><c> nothing</c><00:08:10.879><c> but</c><00:08:11.120><c> slave</c><00:08:11.360><c> away</c><00:08:11.680><c> in</c><00:08:11.840><c> salt</c>

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
does nothing but slave away in salt
 

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.430 align:start position:0%
does nothing but slave away in salt
mines

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
mines
 

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.110 align:start position:0%
mines
so

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.510 align:start position:0%
so
okay<00:08:15.360><c> so</c><00:08:15.520><c> pinocchio</c><00:08:16.160><c> goes</c><00:08:16.400><c> home</c><00:08:17.039><c> that</c><00:08:17.280><c> doesn't</c>

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay so pinocchio goes home that doesn't
 

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.270 align:start position:0%
okay so pinocchio goes home that doesn't
work<00:08:17.840><c> and</c><00:08:17.919><c> that's</c><00:08:18.080><c> where</c><00:08:18.240><c> we're</c><00:08:18.400><c> gonna</c><00:08:18.960><c> start</c>

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
work and that's where we're gonna start
 

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.189 align:start position:0%
work and that's where we're gonna start
here

00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
here
 

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:23.350 align:start position:0%
here
okay<00:08:21.599><c> so</c><00:08:21.840><c> what's</c><00:08:22.080><c> happened</c><00:08:22.479><c> there</c>

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay so what's happened there
 

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.309 align:start position:0%
okay so what's happened there
well

00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
well
 

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:27.189 align:start position:0%
well
many<00:08:24.720><c> many</c><00:08:25.039><c> things</c><00:08:25.680><c> at</c><00:08:26.000><c> multiple</c><00:08:26.560><c> levels</c><00:08:26.960><c> of</c>

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
many many things at multiple levels of
 

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:29.670 align:start position:0%
many many things at multiple levels of
reality<00:08:27.759><c> simultaneously</c><00:08:28.800><c> and</c><00:08:28.879><c> that's</c><00:08:29.280><c> the</c>

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
reality simultaneously and that's the
 

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.230 align:start position:0%
reality simultaneously and that's the
characteristic<00:08:30.400><c> of</c><00:08:30.479><c> an</c><00:08:30.639><c> archetypal</c><00:08:31.199><c> story</c>

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
characteristic of an archetypal story
 

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.110 align:start position:0%
characteristic of an archetypal story
so<00:08:32.479><c> on</c><00:08:32.640><c> one</c><00:08:32.880><c> level</c><00:08:33.680><c> pinocchio's</c><00:08:34.479><c> too</c><00:08:34.719><c> old</c><00:08:34.959><c> to</c>

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
so on one level pinocchio's too old to
 

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.909 align:start position:0%
so on one level pinocchio's too old to
go<00:08:35.279><c> home</c><00:08:35.760><c> he</c><00:08:36.000><c> can't</c><00:08:36.240><c> go</c><00:08:36.479><c> home</c><00:08:37.200><c> to</c><00:08:37.360><c> his</c><00:08:37.599><c> father</c>

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
go home he can't go home to his father
 

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.509 align:start position:0%
go home he can't go home to his father
because<00:08:38.240><c> in</c><00:08:38.399><c> some</c><00:08:38.640><c> sense</c><00:08:38.959><c> he's</c><00:08:39.200><c> already</c>

00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
because in some sense he's already
 

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.430 align:start position:0%
because in some sense he's already
transcended<00:08:40.159><c> his</c><00:08:40.399><c> father</c>

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
transcended his father
 

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.870 align:start position:0%
transcended his father
so<00:08:41.599><c> there</c><00:08:41.760><c> are</c><00:08:41.919><c> things</c><00:08:42.159><c> for</c><00:08:42.320><c> example</c><00:08:42.719><c> that</c>

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
so there are things for example that
 

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.389 align:start position:0%
so there are things for example that
your<00:08:43.039><c> father</c><00:08:43.360><c> can't</c><00:08:43.599><c> help</c><00:08:43.760><c> you</c><00:08:43.919><c> with</c><00:08:44.159><c> and</c><00:08:44.320><c> the</c>

00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
your father can't help you with and the
 

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.829 align:start position:0%
your father can't help you with and the
reason<00:08:44.720><c> for</c><00:08:44.880><c> that</c><00:08:45.120><c> is</c><00:08:45.200><c> that</c><00:08:45.360><c> you</c><00:08:45.440><c> don't</c><00:08:45.760><c> he</c>

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that you don't he
 

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:46.790 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that you don't he
doesn't<00:08:46.080><c> know</c><00:08:46.240><c> any</c><00:08:46.320><c> more</c><00:08:46.560><c> about</c><00:08:46.720><c> the</c>

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't know any more about the
 

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.949 align:start position:0%
doesn't know any more about the
situation<00:08:47.279><c> than</c><00:08:47.440><c> you</c><00:08:47.600><c> do</c><00:08:47.839><c> and</c><00:08:48.000><c> he</c><00:08:48.160><c> can't</c><00:08:48.800><c> and</c>

00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
situation than you do and he can't and
 

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:51.190 align:start position:0%
situation than you do and he can't and
so<00:08:49.120><c> that's</c><00:08:49.440><c> where</c><00:08:49.600><c> his</c><00:08:49.839><c> knowledge</c><00:08:50.240><c> limits</c><00:08:50.640><c> out</c>

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
so that's where his knowledge limits out
 

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.030 align:start position:0%
so that's where his knowledge limits out
so<00:08:51.360><c> that</c><00:08:51.519><c> would</c><00:08:51.680><c> be</c><00:08:51.920><c> sort</c><00:08:52.080><c> of</c><00:08:52.240><c> on</c><00:08:52.320><c> the</c><00:08:52.480><c> personal</c>

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
so that would be sort of on the personal
 

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.190 align:start position:0%
so that would be sort of on the personal
level<00:08:53.600><c> and</c><00:08:53.680><c> then</c><00:08:53.920><c> on</c><00:08:54.080><c> the</c><00:08:54.240><c> trans-personal</c>

think he can get out of the whale and so
 

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.629 align:start position:0%
think he can get out of the whale and so
he<00:16:29.440><c> might</c><00:16:29.600><c> as</c><00:16:29.680><c> well</c><00:16:29.839><c> have</c><00:16:30.000><c> some</c><00:16:30.160><c> fish</c><00:16:30.480><c> while</c>

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
pinocchio as if he's a fish
 

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.670 align:start position:0%
pinocchio as if he's a fish
so<00:16:40.160><c> pinocchio</c><00:16:40.720><c> is</c><00:16:40.800><c> put</c><00:16:41.040><c> into</c><00:16:41.199><c> the</c><00:16:41.360><c> same</c>

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
so pinocchio is put into the same
 

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.069 align:start position:0%
so pinocchio is put into the same

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:50.870 align:start position:0%

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
what that means in some sense is that
 

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.110 align:start position:0%
what that means in some sense is that

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.629 align:start position:0%
and whatever it is that pinocchio
represents<00:16:57.519><c> and</c><00:16:57.600><c> so</c><00:16:57.759><c> you</c><00:16:57.920><c> could</c><00:16:58.000><c> think</c><00:16:58.240><c> about</c>

00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
represents and so you could think about
 

00:16:58.639 --> 00:17:00.949 align:start position:0%
represents and so you could think about
pinocchio<00:16:59.199><c> as</c><00:16:59.360><c> a</c><00:16:59.440><c> fisherman</c><00:17:00.160><c> instead</c><00:17:00.480><c> of</c><00:17:00.639><c> as</c><00:17:00.800><c> a</c>

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
if you give a man a fish you feed him
 

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.029 align:start position:0%
if you give a man a fish you feed him
for<00:17:09.039><c> one</c><00:17:09.199><c> day</c><00:17:09.360><c> but</c><00:17:09.520><c> if</c><00:17:09.600><c> you</c><00:17:09.760><c> teach</c><00:17:10.079><c> him</c><00:17:10.160><c> to</c><00:17:10.319><c> fish</c>

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%

you<00:17:11.199><c> feed</c><00:17:11.439><c> him</c><00:17:11.520><c> forever</c><00:17:12.240><c> and</c><00:17:12.319><c> so</c><00:17:12.480><c> the</c><00:17:12.640><c> idea</c><00:17:12.959><c> is</c>

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
you feed him forever and so the idea is
 

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
you feed him forever and so the idea is
it's<00:17:13.280><c> better</c><00:17:13.919><c> to</c><00:17:14.079><c> develop</c><00:17:14.400><c> the</c><00:17:14.559><c> skill</c><00:17:14.880><c> to</c>

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's better to develop the skill to
