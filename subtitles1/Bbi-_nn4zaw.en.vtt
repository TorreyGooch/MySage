00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.520
should accept yourself just the way you are&nbsp;
what does that say about who I should become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.780
is that just now off the table because I'm&nbsp;
already good enough in every way so am I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.020
done or something get the hell up get your&nbsp;
act together adopt some responsibility put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.080
your life together develop a vision unfold&nbsp;
all those manifold possibilities that lurk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.460
within be a force for good in the world and&nbsp;
that'll be the adventure of your life [Music]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.360
prices go up all the time because the government&nbsp;
is so involved that's why it keeps getting more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.060
expensive and the quality goes down the quality&nbsp;
of Education I mean a high school degree you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.280
know 50 years ago is is way more valuable than a&nbsp;
college degree today even a master's degree the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.520
governments have destroyed the value of degrees&nbsp;
while dramatically increasing the price to to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.640
one so government drives quality down and price&nbsp;
up the free market does the reverse government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.700
let's say the post office right post office was&nbsp;
a problem and so then FedEx came along right and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.100
okay we can avoid the post office or more recently&nbsp;
uh governments create monopolies in taxi cabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.740
well Uber comes along Lyft comes along&nbsp;
and and creates some competition to these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.880
government monopolies so the same thing is going&nbsp;
to happen with money government money is is so bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.060
and it's going to get worse that the market is&nbsp;
going to offer Alternatives yes the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.300
is going to try to put up roadblocks to protect&nbsp;
its Monopoly but ultimately it won't work

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.680
[Music]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.460
hello everyone I am speaking today with Peter&nbsp;
Schiff The Economist and stock broker who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.400
successfully predicted the 2008 housing&nbsp;
crisis today we will discuss the current&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.840
market hyperinflation fiat currency and&nbsp;
the value of gold in times of instability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.460
looking forward to the conversation so thank you&nbsp;
very much for talking to me today and to everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.740
who's watching and listening thank you for your&nbsp;
time and attention that's much appreciated so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.620
the first thing I guess I might ask is what do&nbsp;
you think it is that the typical person who's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.280
watching or listening should know on the financial&nbsp;
front practically for their own protection and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.540
and incremental wisdom that they don't know I mean&nbsp;
people are aren't taught even the basics of how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.880
think financially in our education system and so&nbsp;
maybe you could walk through what you regard as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.720
the as the basics of fun of financial literacy on&nbsp;
the Practical front uh well there's a lot there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:06.480
but I think the the most pertinent thing that&nbsp;
people need to understand before they make any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.000
Investments really particularly now is inflation&nbsp;
and the impact that inflation is going to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.720
on the decisions that they make on their&nbsp;
savings and their investment because inflation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:31.860
is probably a bigger threat now than it's ever&nbsp;
been and therefore it's a even bigger Factor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.240
in determining everything that we do and&nbsp;
ultimately uh what the rewards are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.700
to be or the returns from your Investments&nbsp;
and and the reason I think that inflation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:55.020
is a bigger problem now then it's it's been in&nbsp;
the past is because of the fiscal predicament&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:02.160
that most of the major governments&nbsp;
have you know put themselves in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:12.720
and the fact that all politicians unfortunately&nbsp;
and this is a a fatal flaw in democracy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:22.500
is that politicians first and foremost care about&nbsp;
themselves and their own political career and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.080
their own re-election that's what they do for&nbsp;
a living they are career politicians and so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.040
know like anybody else you know they're&nbsp;
they're they're you know concerned about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.100
perpetuating their career and most people who are&nbsp;
in politics they really enjoy it I mean they they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.320
like all the perks that come with it uh you&nbsp;
know you get a lot of uh you know respect if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.960
you're you know United States or Congressman&nbsp;
you're a senator uh you know it it's it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.400
it's a career that a lot of people would aspire&nbsp;
to and once you get there you know once you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.140
to Washington and I'm sure this is true and you&nbsp;
know every you know country in Europe and all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.380
around the world that you know you like it right&nbsp;
you like the lifestyle you like The Prestige that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.620
comes with being a government official so you&nbsp;
want to stay there right well how do you stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.960
in office well you got to keep getting elected&nbsp;
you know in the United States you know we get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.620
elections every two years right so politicians&nbsp;
are are very concerned about you know the polls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.080
and they're constantly got their finger in the&nbsp;
air seeing where the winds are blowing and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.780
don't want to say anything or do anything that&nbsp;
might jeopardize their re-election and of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.220
one of the most important things that you need to&nbsp;
get reelected is you need a lot of money you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:47.100
to spend money on advertising on television which&nbsp;
is expensive and so you tend to cater to donors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.360
um whether it's a corporation or a a you know&nbsp;
a union anyone that can provide a lot of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.920
uh you need to do things that are in their&nbsp;
interest and so what is usually sacrificed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.940
these politicians is the national interest doing&nbsp;
what's right for the country is secondary to doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:16.200
what's right for themselves and also in order to&nbsp;
be as successful as a politician you have to be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.200
really good liar and that's probably why a lot of&nbsp;
lawyers go into politics because lawyers you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.420
they're paid to lie I mean you have to argue your&nbsp;
client's case even if you know they're wrong right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.100
and you have to put on a defense or whatever it&nbsp;
is and and so lawyers are generally pretty good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.560
liars and so they they they they be they become&nbsp;
politicians because if you're honest and you tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.880
the truth you're not going to have a career&nbsp;
in politics you're you're just not gonna even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.140
if you manage to get elected telling the truth&nbsp;
you're not going to stay in office telling the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:54.480
truth so you got to lie so here's the situation&nbsp;
so you've had Decades of politicians buying their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.820
re-election by promising voters something for&nbsp;
nothing because unfortunately that's what a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.680
lot of Voters want they want something from the&nbsp;
government so if you're running for office like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:11.160
I ran for office in in 2010 I was in Connecticut&nbsp;
uh but you know all I promised was more freedom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.900
I'm going to leave you alone I'm going to repeal&nbsp;
government laws regulations I'm gonna I'm Gonna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.520
Leave You free to do what you want and I'm not&nbsp;
going to interfere with you some people like that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.480
message but a lot of people that's not what they&nbsp;
want they don't want to be free they want to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.300
taken care of they want to know what are you going&nbsp;
to give me what stuff am I going to get if I vote&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.520
for you right what free stuff and so yeah well&nbsp;
that's attractive in the short term especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.660
if you're not paying attention right and lots&nbsp;
people don't pay that much attention to political&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:47.400
discounts and so if you offer something tangible&nbsp;
and immediate that's grip short-term attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.700
and that can be an effective strategy yeah and if&nbsp;
you and so it's this proclivity to gift in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.980
manner that to the drives inflation do you want&nbsp;
to define inflation yeah I will decide I know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.540
exactly what we're talking about yeah yeah I will&nbsp;
I'm getting there but and it's even worse when it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:10.560
comes to trying to take away something like if you&nbsp;
want to cut a program spending that's even worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:16.620
because once a voter has something nobody wants to&nbsp;
take it away in fact even some of the politicians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.500
let's say Republicans United States that might&nbsp;
have opposed certain government welfare type&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:29.280
programs you know when they started once they're&nbsp;
in place even those people won't vote to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.980
them away that's how how a danger it is so the&nbsp;
situation is you've had all these politicians who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:41.640
have promised so much stuff that the taxpayers&nbsp;
can't deliver and of course when politicians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.820
want to give voters something they don't want them&nbsp;
to pay for it so they want to spend money but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.320
don't want to raise taxes because governments&nbsp;
don't have any money they only have the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.660
they take they have to take money from the people&nbsp;
in order to give money back to the people and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:05.040
so if the government's taking your money that you&nbsp;
don't like so with paper money which unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:11.280
we have now fiat currency where the governments&nbsp;
don't need gold real money they could just create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.020
paper money out of thin air right they could&nbsp;
just manufacture it digitally and there it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:24.240
that enables governments to spend without&nbsp;
collecting taxes they run these large deficits and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:31.320
they're able to print the difference and hand out&nbsp;
that money so they can give people money without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.600
also taking the money away and now they don't&nbsp;
mind taking money away from rich people because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.340
you know there's not as many of those right so&nbsp;
they don't lose as many votes although certain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:47.400
rich people can donate a lot to their campaigns&nbsp;
which often you know prevents the taxes from from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:57.780
getting too high but inflation I asked for the&nbsp;
definition inflation is really just another tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:08.040
because governments create inflation and inflation&nbsp;
is also probably one of the most misunderstood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:14.100
words in the English language and deliberately so&nbsp;
I think governments around the world kind of led&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:20.640
the campaign to redefine inflation so if you go&nbsp;
back to the origin of the word and if you if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.280
have a dictionary even from the 1980s a Webster's&nbsp;
dictionary you'll get the real definition of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:33.000
inflation so inflation is an expansion of the&nbsp;
money supply that's all it is deflation is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.440
contraction of the money supply so if you even&nbsp;
think about the word inflate inflate is to expand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:47.640
like a balloon if you if you fill a balloon with&nbsp;
air it expands so with inflation what's being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:54.780
expanded is the money supply and who expands&nbsp;
the money supply governments you know or they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.640
they do it generally now through a central bank&nbsp;
but it's the central banks of these governments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.900
that are expanding the money supply now when&nbsp;
you expand the money supply you have more money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.720
well if you have more money but you don't have&nbsp;
more stuff to buy well the price of everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:16.260
goes up that's just basic economic supply and&nbsp;
demand the more money there is the less each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:23.580
individual monetary unit is worth and now prices&nbsp;
go up now what governments have done is they've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:31.320
said price is going up that's inflation no it's&nbsp;
not that is the consequence of inflation because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:37.860
prices don't expand prices go up and down as a&nbsp;
result of inflation now what happens is sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.400
prices don't go up but you still have inflation&nbsp;
and that's because without that inflation prices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.820
would have gone down and if prices don't go down&nbsp;
because government creates inflation that still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:59.400
represents a loss to the people because they lost&nbsp;
the benefit of lower prices because in capitalism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:06.960
the tendency of capitalism is to reduce prices&nbsp;
that's why it's so good because you keep coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:13.260
up with better ways of producing more efficient&nbsp;
ways economies of scale if you look at the CPI for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:19.980
example in the United States in in 1800 and then&nbsp;
you look at the same CPI in 1900 and they have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:26.220
data prices were cut in half you had a hundred&nbsp;
year period where you had deflation or you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:32.040
the money or prices falling for 100 years uh and&nbsp;
that was a good thing you know all the politicians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:38.100
now tell us that we need prices to go up that we&nbsp;
must have inflation you know the way they Define&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:44.400
it of two percent a year why why do prices have&nbsp;
to go up every year why can't they go down every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.140
year isn't that better if stuff gets cheaper you&nbsp;
know if the cost of living goes down of course it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:56.460
is but these politicians are trying to sell this&nbsp;
lie to the public that Rising prices are somehow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:02.400
necessary for Prosperity that if prices don't go&nbsp;
up okay so let me sum up let me sum up what you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.280
said so the first thing you said that I think&nbsp;
is worthy of note for people to remember is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.940
the price of something is a function of the ratio&nbsp;
of the money available to the goods available&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.920
and so if you make money twice as&nbsp;
available then things cost twice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.320
as much and that's and then you Defined&nbsp;
inflation you Defined inflation in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:31.440
regard you said inflation isn't prices going&nbsp;
up inflation is the value of money going down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.380
and so it isn't because things are becoming more&nbsp;
expensive it's because there's more money chasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:43.380
the same amount or fewer items now you could&nbsp;
imagine an inflation in a particular sector that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:49.080
would emerge because that thing has become more&nbsp;
scarce but General inflation is a reflection of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:55.260
the inflation of the money supply right then you&nbsp;
said well here's here's the let me just finish the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:00.960
summary you said there's drivers of that inflation&nbsp;
of the money supply and the basic driver is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:08.220
because we have a fiat currency that isn't paid&nbsp;
to something um permanent let's say like gold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:14.340
and because politicians can create money&nbsp;
by printing it they're incentivized to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:20.040
so because they can offer people who aren't&nbsp;
paying much attention cheap gifts for nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.100
and the fastest way to pay for that because they&nbsp;
don't want to raise taxes is to increase the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.840
supply and then you might say and this is where&nbsp;
we could bring this home to land is well what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:37.020
so bad about that is that we defer our expenses&nbsp;
into the future people get more free stuff from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:42.960
the government there's a bit of a tax that's&nbsp;
the inflation tax let's say but all in all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.840
system works pretty well but you started this&nbsp;
whole discussion by saying the biggest threat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:56.100
to the financial Integrity of people individuals&nbsp;
over the long run is inflation and so why does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:01.560
that pose the Cardinal danger to long-term&nbsp;
Financial Security and prosperity for people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.840
yeah well first of all it's not it's not working&nbsp;
well that that is the problem it it worked much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.940
better when we had honest money when we were on&nbsp;
a gold standard uh if governments wanted to spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.200
money they needed gold and where did they get it&nbsp;
they had to collect taxes because they couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:22.620
create the gold it needed to be mined and and&nbsp;
so it was an honest system um and it it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:27.660
discipline on politicians now the politicians&nbsp;
don't want to be disciplined any more than you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.800
know teenagers want to chaperone at the prom right&nbsp;
so you know they want to they want to do a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:38.700
stuff that The Chaperone won't allow and so gold&nbsp;
uh was keeping politicians in check but to your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:45.360
point about individual prices you can't confuse&nbsp;
prices individually will go up and down based on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.520
the supply and demand but if the price of one&nbsp;
thing goes up it's going to necessitate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:56.220
price of something else to go down uh and so the&nbsp;
general level of prices won't change uh it's only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:00.660
when you have the expansion of the money supply&nbsp;
that the price of everything goes up because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:06.960
value of money is going down and so now you need&nbsp;
more money to to buy stuff but the problem now is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:14.880
because these governments have run such enormous&nbsp;
deficits uh and it you know inflated you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:21.000
the housing bubble that popped in 2008 the US and&nbsp;
then uh a decade or more of massive deficit spent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.700
ending quantitative easing programs and by the way&nbsp;
quantitative easing is inflation they basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.880
get you know taken inflation and put a nice&nbsp;
sounding name to it because quantitative easing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:39.180
is printing money and buying government bonds that&nbsp;
that's inflation but if the politicians said our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:44.160
policy is inflation you know the public doesn't&nbsp;
like that so they said no we're doing quantitative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:50.880
easing and somehow that sounds you know more&nbsp;
palatable than inflation but they've created&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.980
so much and and for years and years these Central&nbsp;
Bankers were telling us that inflation is too low&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:02.520
we don't have enough inflation because it's not&nbsp;
two percent and again we don't need prices to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.500
up you know and the reason they say that price&nbsp;
prices have to go up is they claim that we won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.840
buy stuff that if we think prices are going to go&nbsp;
down we'll just hold off on buying indefinitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:17.340
waiting for a cheaper price and the economy&nbsp;
is going to collapse and that's a bunch of BS&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:22.440
because you buy things when you need them and when&nbsp;
you can afford them I mean if if that was true&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:27.600
nobody would own a cell phone nobody would own&nbsp;
a laptop computer nobody would have a television&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:33.000
that because all those things get cheaper every&nbsp;
year yet we keep buying them so it's nonsense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.400
that we won't buy if price is going down in fact&nbsp;
price is going down create demand if you can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.260
afford something the way to have to buy it is for&nbsp;
the price to go down and then you can afford it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:50.580
and then you buy it but they've created so much&nbsp;
inflation when they said it was too low that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:56.220
now it's exploded right you've got double-digit&nbsp;
inflation or high single digit inflation pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:03.840
much in all the invest economies in the world and&nbsp;
no government anywhere in the world is willing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:10.260
to actually do what it takes to reduce inflation&nbsp;
because a they have to accept responsibility for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:18.660
creating it and then B they have to significantly&nbsp;
reduce government spending and or raise taxes on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:24.480
on middle class uh voters and neither of&nbsp;
those choices are politically expedient&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:31.560
and so politicians now are under more pressure&nbsp;
than ever to continue to finance their spending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:39.720
through inflation so the inflation tax is going&nbsp;
to get bigger and bigger and bigger uh every year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:47.460
and the reason that that's such a problem is&nbsp;
it's really the worst possible tax because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:54.420
it impacts the people the most who can afford it&nbsp;
the least it's the middle class the Working Poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.420 --> 00:19:01.980
uh and the retirees who are living off of fixed&nbsp;
income uh they end up paying the inflation tax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:09.840
the most uh they have some savings they have a&nbsp;
pension they have an annuity a cash value and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:15.780
insurance policies all this stuff gets uh&nbsp;
destroyed wealthier people who tend to own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:22.620
assets and who have more good debt right bad debt&nbsp;
is Consumer Debt you go out and you borrow money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:28.260
and you spend it you buy a consumer good you&nbsp;
buy a TV with your credit card and that's bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.940
debt or you take a vacation and you pay for&nbsp;
it on a credit card but if you buy an asset&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:40.500
particularly an income producing asset a piece&nbsp;
of property uh if you a business a comp stock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.900
if you borrow money and you buy an asset and&nbsp;
that asset is appreciating and generating income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.840
inflation is your friend inflation helps&nbsp;
you out because it wipes out the value of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:57.360
your debt and you still have the asset so&nbsp;
wealthy people very wealthy people if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:03.960
invest the right way will benefit from inflation&nbsp;
whereas Ordinary People are going to get hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.740
have you ever read the fine print that appears&nbsp;
when you start browsing in incognito mode it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:15.540
free expressvpn.com Jordan [Music] so inflation&nbsp;
is particularly hard on non-entrepreneurial savers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.600
so people who've put put away a certain store&nbsp;
of value maybe that's in a pension who aren't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:27.060
invested in some active Enterprise that could&nbsp;
be generating Revenue it just devastates them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.980
and if it's four percent a year they lose what&nbsp;
what does that mean they lose half the value&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:36.780
of their investment in like four percent&nbsp;
a year would be something like 10 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:43.560
yeah and so unfortunately it's going to be a&nbsp;
lot higher than than four percent yeah let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.960
talk about that for a second so two things&nbsp;
two questions about that that are that come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:55.980
along with what you've already laid out the first&nbsp;
question is how is the inflation rate calculated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:01.500
that's mysterious right because yeah that's it&nbsp;
Consumer Price Index that's another big part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:07.740
the fraud because certainly in America and I know&nbsp;
a lot more about the U.S CPI let's say than I do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:13.620
about cpis in other countries but my assumption is&nbsp;
that you know the politicians are being dishonest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:22.320
everywhere because you know the inflation rate&nbsp;
it's like a report card and if our kids were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.600
responsible for grading their own report cards it&nbsp;
wouldn't be as shocker if they came home with all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:33.960
A's right so that this is the problem that we've&nbsp;
hired the government to grade its own you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:40.080
is its own Pro success you know in the economy&nbsp;
because High inflation would would be would be bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:46.800
um so the government again when they're measuring&nbsp;
inflation and they're looking at prices they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:54.480
looking at an effect they're not looking at&nbsp;
the thing itself but over the years governments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:02.400
have changed the methodology for measuring&nbsp;
price increases so the CPI that we use today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:08.940
is nothing like the one that we use say in the&nbsp;
1970s yeah that's exactly what I want to focus on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:15.420
because so the CPI for everyone listing that's the&nbsp;
Consumer Price Index and it's in principle please&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:21.900
correct me if I've got any of this wrong it's the&nbsp;
average cost of something like a standard basket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:28.200
of goods that's what a question then is which&nbsp;
Goods yeah okay so let's go into that it used to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:35.340
be there was the basket didn't change they picked&nbsp;
a basket and they just measured the same basket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.740
year after year and so you could see the changes&nbsp;
now the basket changes the politicians decide what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:49.020
to put in the basket and when to take out and&nbsp;
generally they take out stuff that's gone up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:54.840
and they put in stuff that hasn't gone up as&nbsp;
much there's all this substitution there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:00.180
lot of other indexes that they use where they&nbsp;
have hedonics or it is CPI there's hedonics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:08.460
and so what hedonics is is the statisticians who&nbsp;
compute the CPI they look at a product and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:14.700
don't use the actual price they subjectively&nbsp;
decide if they think that product got better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:20.280
and if they think it got better they adjust&nbsp;
the price down now maybe it did get better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:26.940
and a lot of times stuff gets worse and&nbsp;
they don't they don't adjust for that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.220
um like let's say they're looking at airline&nbsp;
prices and they just look at the ticket price&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.180
and they say wait a minute but you're charged&nbsp;
extra for luggage you're charged extra for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.440
blanket you're charged extra for food oh you&nbsp;
know they just look at the price you know a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.360
of quality has gone down and a lot of things&nbsp;
that hasn't been captured and you know I did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:52.680
this exercise I did this a long time ago in 2013&nbsp;
and I made a YouTube video about it but I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:52.680 --> 00:25:00.900
did this for kicks I looked at the CPI in 2013.&nbsp;
and according to the CPI over the prior 10 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:10.620
um the the price of newspapers and magazines had&nbsp;
gone up about 30 percent according to the CPI in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:16.860
2013 magazines and newspapers were 30 percent&nbsp;
more expensive than they were in 2003. well I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:21.480
decided to check because it's easy to do you know&nbsp;
you could just go on the internet and you could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:27.900
see a picture of those magazines because they put&nbsp;
the price right on the cover so I took about 20 I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:34.860
took like 20 of the most circulated newspapers and&nbsp;
magazines in the country and I just looked at what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:41.580
the price was in 2003 and then I took the exact&nbsp;
same magazines and I looked at the price on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:48.300
cover and I just compared it over the the 10 years&nbsp;
and what I found was that the actual increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:54.720
in price wasn't 30 it was a hundred and thirty&nbsp;
percent so the question is where did that extra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:04.740
100 go because you know that those are the prices&nbsp;
so obviously the CPI is rigged in such a way as to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:10.380
have a a number it's not that people lie when they&nbsp;
calculate like they get a certain number and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:19.980
say oh no that's too high the methodology that is&nbsp;
used has been engineered to mask the real degree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:26.760
to which prices are rising you also pointed to&nbsp;
something else that's a fundamental flaw if your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:33.840
reasoning is correct which is that if inflation is&nbsp;
best construed as ratio of money to Goods merely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.640
calculating inflation as a consequence of price&nbsp;
increase doesn't capture the essential element&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.560
of the inflation because that's a huge problem&nbsp;
too because let's say prices should have gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:50.160
down by three percent and instead they go up by&nbsp;
two percent that's five percent inflation in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.920
my cost of living is five percent higher than it&nbsp;
would have been um had you not had the inflation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.800
and again if you think about inflation as a tax&nbsp;
when the government taxes you legitimately let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.900
say through a sales tax or an income tax whatever&nbsp;
the government takes your money money that you had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.440
goes to the government and then the government&nbsp;
takes that money and gives it to somebody else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.820
right you lose your money but when they tax you&nbsp;
through inflation they don't take any of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.780
money you get to keep your money but they print&nbsp;
new money and they give that money to somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:24.120
else now when that's somebody else spends that&nbsp;
money that he didn't earn it drives up your prices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:29.880
so now you pay more so the government didn't&nbsp;
take your money they took your purchasing power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.940
so it's the same thing and you know another&nbsp;
thing about our CPI that they how they changed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:43.440
is Once Upon a Time back in the 70s housing&nbsp;
prices were in the CPI and and so were rents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:50.760
and and that's about a third of the CPI which is&nbsp;
shelter but somewhere along the way they decided&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:55.500
to use something called owner's equivalent&nbsp;
rent instead of actual rent or actual home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.820
prices now what is owner's equivalent&nbsp;
rent well it's a fiction that they made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:06.420
up that nobody actually pays apparently&nbsp;
uh the government calls people at random&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:13.260
and asks them if they own their home how much do&nbsp;
they think they could rent it for if they were to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:19.440
rent it and they keep track of those numbers now&nbsp;
I don't know like you know who they're asking I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.760
mean I've owned homes for a long time I've never&nbsp;
gotten a call from a government guy wanting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.380
know what I think I could rent my house for but if&nbsp;
you're not a landlord and you're not in the rental&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.580
market how the hell do you know what you could&nbsp;
rent in your house for it's such a ridiculous way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:38.940
to try to measure the cost of Shelter by using&nbsp;
a number okay so let me okay so let me ask you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:44.400
a question about that because I've really been&nbsp;
curious about that because it's obvious the K the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.380
case in Canada in particular like housing and rent&nbsp;
prices have skyrocketed in the last eight years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.740
and that's not reflected in the inflation&nbsp;
statistics and that seems to be a major oversight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:00.420
at least according to one line of argumentation&nbsp;
because that's one-third of what people spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.880
their money on now you could argue this is where&nbsp;
it gets complicated as far as I can tell that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:15.600
if what you've bought is an asset that generates&nbsp;
income and its value goes up that's actually not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:21.000
a cost to you it's an advantage you already&nbsp;
made reference well only if you if you own the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.340
asset yes if you own it if you want to buy it and&nbsp;
the price has gone up it's a disadvantage right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:31.980
because now the assets that you want to buy&nbsp;
are more more costly right so does that imply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:40.080
that a proper CPI that would include the cost of&nbsp;
shelter would be calculated on the basis of those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:45.060
who want to buy rather than those who already&nbsp;
own yeah because I'm trying to figure out how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:50.580
to measure inflation properly here right you're&nbsp;
very complicated problem if you already own a home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:56.940
then the cost of buying another one is not as&nbsp;
important to you of course a lot of people that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:01.680
own homes they may want to buy bigger homes as&nbsp;
their families grow and and so it would be but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:10.560
for those people what's important are uh your&nbsp;
maintenance costs your insurance costs your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:17.100
property taxes uh there are a lot of other factors&nbsp;
that would be significant to you if you don't own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:22.980
if you're a renter then obviously rent is of&nbsp;
primary importance to you you're you're paying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:28.560
rent there's all sorts of valid ways that the&nbsp;
government could measure shelter as a component&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.060
of the cost of living but in the United States&nbsp;
they don't choose any of those valid ways they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:38.160
choose another way and they're doing that because&nbsp;
they want the number to be lower they don't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:44.700
to report High inflation and they even do this as&nbsp;
part of the GNP because when they deport report&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:49.860
GDP they don't even do GNP anymore it's GDP&nbsp;
now that they report gross domestic product&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:56.700
in order to get the number they have to deflate it&nbsp;
every there's a deflator which adjusts the GDP for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:03.840
prices and the government always underestimates&nbsp;
that deflator so the GDP looks bigger than it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:08.940
really is because in many cases economies are&nbsp;
actually Contracting in real terms but because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:15.240
the government is dishonest in the way it reports&nbsp;
it it reports economic growth even though there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.560
is no real growth it's inflation which creates&nbsp;
the illusion of growth that's another reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:24.540
that politicians like inflation and of course when&nbsp;
inflation drives up the stock market and the real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:29.700
estate market people think they're richer right&nbsp;
because oh my house has gone way up my stock but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:35.700
it hasn't gone up your money has gone down right&nbsp;
but people don't necessarily connect those dots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:40.680
uh you know they they think they're they think&nbsp;
they're wealthier but also if you think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:46.860
as I said earlier inflation benefits debtors&nbsp;
it's a transfer of wealth from creditors to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:54.840
debtors who are the biggest debtors in the world&nbsp;
governments and the biggest most highly indebted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:59.640
government is the United States government we&nbsp;
have 32 trillion dollars of funded debt almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:04.680
and our unfunded liabilities commitments that have&nbsp;
been made where they didn't borrow the money but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:10.440
they're on the hook like guaranteed student loans&nbsp;
or a guaranteed pensions Social Security Medicare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:16.020
all that stuff that's like a hundred trillion&nbsp;
so when the government creates inflation they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:22.920
repudiate enormous amounts of their debt and so&nbsp;
the governments have massive incentives to create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:28.680
inflation but then they have massive incentives to&nbsp;
lie about it and pretend it's not as bad as it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:35.040
and blame other people which is the main reason&nbsp;
that they redefine inflation from the expansion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:40.140
of the money supply to Rising prices because&nbsp;
when you know inflation is an expansion of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:46.560
money supply then you know who causes it it's the&nbsp;
government you can't blame greedy corporations for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:52.260
it you can't blame Putin for it Putin doesn't&nbsp;
print our money we do the Federal Reserve does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:58.080
and so when politicians can redefine inflation&nbsp;
they can they can blame everybody but themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:04.680
okay so so let me ask you a kind of a modified&nbsp;
Ponzi scheme question because this is something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:10.140
that's bedeviled me so I understand that so I&nbsp;
have two questions I understand that getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:15.960
the measurements of something as fundamental&nbsp;
as inflation correct is absolutely necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:22.020
so one of the things I've wondered is like why&nbsp;
aren't there independent teams of economists who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:30.840
generate various true estimates of inflation make&nbsp;
them public so that the public itself could gather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:36.660
a basket of independent estimates and know for&nbsp;
themselves what the inflation rate is very curious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:42.900
about that well they have one other well I mean&nbsp;
there's a website who's reliable who's reliable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.920
yeah you know well I think the least&nbsp;
reliable would be the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:52.740
right yeah yeah you don't want their statistics&nbsp;
because they're completely biased right you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:59.220
it's like you know the mafia is not going to give&nbsp;
you accurate statistics on crime right so um you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:06.720
got to look to Independent sources but um I think&nbsp;
it's kind of obvious though if you understand what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:11.160
inflation is and you see the enormity I mean the&nbsp;
United States is running two trillion dollar a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:16.020
year plus deficits now uh and technically we're&nbsp;
not even in a recession the deficits are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:23.040
get even bigger uh when this next recession starts&nbsp;
but how are we financing those deficits it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.900
inflation there's just no other way they'll look&nbsp;
at the the Federal Reserves balance sheet so we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:36.960
know that inflation is going to be a significant&nbsp;
threat it's going to reduce the value of money and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:48.060
so that has to be the single most important factor&nbsp;
in driving your decisions on savings on investing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:54.660
um you know and and even for in this day and&nbsp;
age if you don't have a lot of money to invest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:59.220
you know I I've been saying this for years to&nbsp;
people I started talking about it several years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:05.100
ago people have to stock up on things you know&nbsp;
you know buy things that you're going to use in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:10.740
a year or two buy it now because it's going to be&nbsp;
a lot more expensive if you wait why hold on to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:16.020
the cash if the cash is going to lose value&nbsp;
uh just buy the things that you're actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:20.580
going to need because those things will retain&nbsp;
their value if you're planning on using them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:29.820
so here's the Ponzi scheme question so because&nbsp;
of the efficiencies of the capitalist system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:39.060
free market system let's say we are generally able&nbsp;
to produce more for less and in some instances we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.980
seem to be doing that faster and faster so&nbsp;
consumer electronics are a good example and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:49.860
price of computation and so forth and so what&nbsp;
that means is that independent of inflation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:56.460
because of technological progress things will get&nbsp;
cheaper in the future the future will be richer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:01.380
than the present so then you might say if you're&nbsp;
a politician you say well if that's the case and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:07.800
if that's invariably the the case then why not&nbsp;
defer our debt to the Future like essentially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.400
why not borrow from the future because the&nbsp;
future is going to be wealthier than the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:18.960
present and then I wonder like if we had a three&nbsp;
percent increment in actual productivity per year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:24.600
then maybe we could tolerate a two percent&nbsp;
inflation rate because fundamentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:30.480
the tendency for things to get cheaper because of&nbsp;
enhanced productivity would be balanced by that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:35.340
inflationary proclivity so are the politicians&nbsp;
could you make a case that the politicians are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:40.380
making a good bet because they're throwing the&nbsp;
debt into the future when we're going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:47.640
richer no well they they are making a politically&nbsp;
opportunistic decision yeah fair enough because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:52.320
they're they're telling the voters hey don't worry&nbsp;
about it your grandkids will pay for it right or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:57.360
whatever uh and and right of course not all voters&nbsp;
have kids right some voters you know don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:02.640
kids and so what do they care if somebody else's&nbsp;
grandchildren uh pay for their for their program&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:13.560
but the only time you could justify borrowing from&nbsp;
the future is if you are creating something that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:18.660
future uh people will benefit from let's say&nbsp;
a capital investment let's say the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:24.180
is going to build a bridge and that bridge is&nbsp;
going to be there for 100 years right uh and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:29.040
and people who aren't even born yet are going&nbsp;
to benefit from that bridge okay maybe they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:34.920
sell bonds to finance the construction of that&nbsp;
bridge that future people will end up paying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.160
because they're going to have the benefit&nbsp;
of that bridge so you can make an argument&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:45.300
for debt to support that but if we're going to&nbsp;
borrow money just to pay for welfare benefits or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:49.980
Social Security benefits where we're leaving our&nbsp;
children and grandchildren with nothing but a bill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:57.060
right they don't have a bridge or a capital asset&nbsp;
uh the money's been spent I see so your argument&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:05.160
basically is is that if you're borrowing from&nbsp;
the future isn't designed specifically to drive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:11.340
productivity let's say then it's a degenerating&nbsp;
bet yeah I don't think it's borrowing from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:15.720
future I think it's stealing from the future&nbsp;
you're trying yeah okay fair enough and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:21.240
yeah but you know a lot of this stuff is going to&nbsp;
backfire because I think the current generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:27.480
is going to pay for a lot of this stuff because&nbsp;
the dollar is going to collapse you know we could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.400
have hyperinflation and and because the future&nbsp;
Generations are not going to pay this they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.880
you know they're they're they're going to leave&nbsp;
that you know they'll leave the countries that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:41.820
because they're not going to want to be subjected&nbsp;
to the confiscatory tax rates when they can't get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:48.000
commensurate benefits from government they're&nbsp;
going to leave uh the the currency is going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.460
to collapse in value and we're already there I&nbsp;
mean we're already at that point because you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:58.140
talking about this intergenerational Ponzi&nbsp;
scheme that's really what Social Security is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:04.500
I mean it wasn't created that way in the 1930s&nbsp;
when Roosevelt uh first uh concocted this social&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:10.440
security and it was totally unconstitutional and&nbsp;
unfortunate that that we haven't but the idea was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:14.880
that it was like Insurance the government was&nbsp;
going to take the money and invest it and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.680
when everybody was older you would get paid&nbsp;
your benefits and they even called the taxes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:24.660
premiums but the whole thing was a con because it&nbsp;
never was Insurance because the government never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:29.940
invested the money they spent the money and now&nbsp;
they gave themselves an IOU they created these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:34.020
things called trust funds and so what would happen&nbsp;
is the government would collect the money from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:38.880
Social Security then they would take the Social&nbsp;
Security money and spend it on whatever military&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:43.260
or whatever they're doing but then they would&nbsp;
put an IOU in the government trust fund in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:48.660
form of a bond and then they would say oh we have&nbsp;
an asset in this trust fund we have a bond that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:54.420
not an asset it's it's your own debt it's like&nbsp;
if I write myself a check for a million dollars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:59.820
I can't take that uncashed check and claim I've&nbsp;
got a million dollar asset no I mean it's also a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:05.640
million dollar liability so there never was any&nbsp;
money in Social Security they spent it all their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:12.300
the system is broke and now they have to keep&nbsp;
raising taxes on the workers but now they won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:17.400
even raise taxes on the workers so they just keep&nbsp;
they create inflation to pay for Social Security

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.280
we'll be right back first we wanted to give you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.760
a sneak peek at Jordan's new&nbsp;
documentary logos and literacy

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:36.780
I was very much struck by how the translation&nbsp;
of the biblical writings jump started the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:42.660
development of literacy across the entire&nbsp;
world illiteracy was the norm the pastor's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:48.540
home was the first school and every morning&nbsp;
into a begin with singing the Christian faith&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:53.460
is a singing religion probably 80 percent&nbsp;
of scripture memorization today exists only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:53.460 --> 00:41:00.780
because of what is sung this is amazing here&nbsp;
we have a Gutenberg Bible printed on the Press&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:08.040
of Johan goodberg science and religion are&nbsp;
opposing forces in the world but historically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:14.400
that has not been the case now the book is&nbsp;
available to everyone from Shakespeare to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:23.040
modern education and medicine and science to to&nbsp;
civilization itself it is the most influential&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:28.440
book in all history and hopefully people&nbsp;
can walk away with at least a sense of that

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:39.180
okay so let me let me offer another Rosy scenario&nbsp;
sort of like the boring from the future scenario&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:45.060
so I've been thinking about this issue of fiat&nbsp;
currency and the fact that the currency is on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:52.380
moored but we have a situation in the world&nbsp;
now where every currency is unmoored right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:59.880
and so you might say no matter what form&nbsp;
of money you use you're making a bad bet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.980
you're relying on something unreliable but if&nbsp;
you're going to rely on something unreliable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.780
you should rely on the least unreliable currency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:17.160
right and so then you might say well the least&nbsp;
unreliable currency becomes by default the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:24.840
standard and the US has managed that for 50 years&nbsp;
60 years and so why isn't it the case because you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:31.560
said for example well people who are subject to&nbsp;
unfair tax because of future deferral of debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:38.640
will leave but I could say yeah but there won't be&nbsp;
anywhere better to go I know there will be and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:46.200
the the whole world doesn't doesn't you know there&nbsp;
have those tax rates of a certain country you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:54.300
um Saddles it's yeah future generations with&nbsp;
too big a debt burden um those you know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:54.300 --> 00:43:00.300
they could leave and go to a country that doesn't&nbsp;
have that demographic problem that big um of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:05.340
dead burden and and and and of course so you think&nbsp;
there'll still be enough call even if everyone's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:08.760
on fiat currency and if all the currencies&nbsp;
are corrupt you still think there'll be enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:13.740
variability oh yeah corruption so that people&nbsp;
will vote with their feet like they are in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:19.680
U.S moving from correct Democrats correct Republic&nbsp;
and states and the idea that you know it's the you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:26.340
have to settle for the least bad uh currency and&nbsp;
again currency isn't even really money money is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:33.540
a commodity gold was money silver you know it&nbsp;
would be money uh legitimate currency which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:40.500
backed by real money is currency what we have now&nbsp;
is fiat currency and and both fiat currency and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:45.660
and legitimate currency are substitutes for money&nbsp;
they're not actual money but they substitute and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:51.240
they can function as money but they're not really&nbsp;
money in the real sense of how you define money as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:57.240
the most marketable commodity which is would be&nbsp;
money but people have been saying well you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:04.740
the dollar is the cleanest shirt in the hamper&nbsp;
and but I I think the dollar only appears clean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:13.800
because of its status as the reserve currency and&nbsp;
I think that status is in Jeopardy and when it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:20.880
lost then the dollar is going to be the the by far&nbsp;
the dirtiest shirt in in in in that hamper so so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:26.220
and okay so two questions from that so first&nbsp;
of all maybe you could walk everybody through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:32.880
why the government is the biggest debtor because&nbsp;
people aren't really clear even for example about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:38.040
the difference between the deficit and the debt&nbsp;
and they don't know what the debt means to them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:43.080
in real terms because it's always expressed in&nbsp;
these huge numbers like 132 trillion it's like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.700
no one knows what that means but they could&nbsp;
figure that out if they knew how much of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:52.800
debt they were responsible for or their family&nbsp;
so you've got you've got two first of all why is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:58.860
the government the big debtor well you've got the&nbsp;
national debt which is the accumulation of every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:05.280
Year's budget deficit and then you've got the the&nbsp;
annual budget deficit which adds to the total debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:12.840
um but what I'm talking about creditors versus&nbsp;
debtors Nations can either be a creditor Nation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:19.260
or a debtor Nation a creditor nation is a nation&nbsp;
in which the world owes it money more money that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:25.560
it owes the world a debtor Nation owes the&nbsp;
world more than it's owed so prior to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:31.440
US going off the gold standard in 1971 and in&nbsp;
fact all the way up to probably the early 1980s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:39.660
the United States was the world's biggest creditor&nbsp;
Nation right we we generated tremendous amounts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:45.120
of wealth um under a Freer economy than the&nbsp;
one we have today and one that was governed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:50.160
by the disciplines of a gold standard so we&nbsp;
became the world's wealthiest creditor Nation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:57.420
today after 50 years of Fiat money America&nbsp;
is not only the world's biggest debtor Nation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:04.020
America owes more money than all the&nbsp;
other debtor nations of the world combined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:12.000
right that's how uh much our financial position&nbsp;
has eroded now when the dollar became the reserve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.720
currency it became the reserve currency because&nbsp;
of America's Financial and Industrial might we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:25.980
were the world's biggest creditor Nation we also&nbsp;
had huge trade surpluses now we have massive trade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.360
deficits I mean over a trillion dollars a year&nbsp;
but when the dollar became the reserve currency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:36.660
we made everything you know all the Consumer&nbsp;
Electronics that are now made in Japan or Korea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:42.540
or China all that stuff was made in America I mean&nbsp;
if you wanted anything we made it in this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:49.380
in America and so since everybody wanted American&nbsp;
Products everybody needed American dollars to buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:54.480
them and the American dollar was as good as gold&nbsp;
because if you had dollars you had gold if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:59.700
had 35 dollars you could get an ounce of gold&nbsp;
from the government it was convertible and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:07.200
under those conditions the US dollar became the&nbsp;
reserve currency but today the the dollar would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.460
never be the reserve currency today if it wasn't&nbsp;
already there right nobody would pick the dollar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:17.280
given our financial position our trade-in&nbsp;
balances but you know it's been the reserve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:24.060
currency because you know for the tradition of&nbsp;
the fact that it's been but in order for the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:33.180
to to maintain this status it's very expensive for&nbsp;
the world it's a huge benefit for America I said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:39.240
we have a trillion dollar a year trade deficit&nbsp;
that means the world has to supply America with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:44.640
a million dollars worth of merchandise for which&nbsp;
it doesn't get paid right it doesn't it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:50.700
get products you know most countries in order to&nbsp;
export have to I mean in order to import have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:55.020
export you have to export something in order&nbsp;
to pay for your Imports well we don't have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:59.700
export anything we just print money and Export&nbsp;
that well that costs nothing but the rest of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:05.280
world has to produce real stuff and and use&nbsp;
resources land labor and capital to produce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:10.860
products so Americans get to live beyond their&nbsp;
means because of the dollar status but the rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:18.540
of the world collectively lives beneath its means&nbsp;
and of course it's not um uh consistent because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:25.020
some countries uh have to live even further below&nbsp;
their means depending on how big a trade Surplus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:30.120
they have with the United States that's how much&nbsp;
they're subsidizing the US economy so a lot of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:38.820
Emerging Markets uh bearing even uh bigger uh uh&nbsp;
uh burden of preserving the dollar status and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:44.820
so I think the world is starting to move away from&nbsp;
the dollar not only because of the economic cost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:53.940
of maintaining it but now we have raised the&nbsp;
political risks if you look at what the Biden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:53.940 --> 00:49:04.980
Administration did with Russia the unprecedented&nbsp;
sanctions on Russia this has really highlighted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:12.600
the tremendous risk that every Sovereign&nbsp;
Nation assumes by being beholden to the dollar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:18.240
because it puts tremendous power in the hands of&nbsp;
the United States it's like putting a noose around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.400
your neck and then throwing throwing it over a&nbsp;
tree to America who's holding the other end then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:28.200
you're hoping that they don't pull I mean nobody&nbsp;
wants to really be in that position especially if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:33.780
you're a country like China where you know we've&nbsp;
kind of made China our enemy but in reality China&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:41.880
provides America with the largest annual subsidy&nbsp;
they're our biggest uh uh uh trade deficit is with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:47.160
China so they Supply us with more merchandise than&nbsp;
anybody else and they're our largest creditor now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:52.860
some people say it's Japan uh but no it's actually&nbsp;
China because you have to take Hong Kong because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:57.780
Hong Kong is part of China so if you take all the&nbsp;
treasuries that Hong Kong owns and the treasuries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:03.120
that China owns that's more than Japan so they're&nbsp;
our biggest Banker they Supply us with credit they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:09.420
Supply us with merchandise right that's all going&nbsp;
to end right China is going to wean itself of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:15.120
okay so well so let's let's go after that so you&nbsp;
said and let me see if I got the reasons right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:23.040
you said well the American dollar could stand as&nbsp;
the um fundamental currency because it had come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:27.900
off the gold standard but had still benefited from&nbsp;
that it was extraordinarily productive it ran huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:34.560
trade surpluses it was a dynamic expanding rich&nbsp;
country with a very stable currency so it could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:39.960
run on that for a long time and and you said&nbsp;
however now if people looked at the American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:46.380
economic situation the American dollar without&nbsp;
that historical context there's no way the US&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:50.940
dollar would be the reserve currency but then&nbsp;
we're back to the dirty shirt in hamper problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:56.580
and I know the Russians and the and the Chinese&nbsp;
and the Brazilians Etc are wrestling with that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:02.100
they're trying to move people away to some degree&nbsp;
from the dollar as a reserve currency but like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:07.740
nobody in the right mind is going to trust the&nbsp;
Chinese currency so where so where do people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:12.300
go if it's not the American dollar that's going&nbsp;
to be the standard for all the reasons you laid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:19.200
out well you know the Euro doesn't look better&nbsp;
really and certainly you have to be insane to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:24.480
use Chinese currency I think see that that is&nbsp;
the false choice that everybody thinks we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:29.700
to make one of the reasons that people are&nbsp;
so arrogant particularly in America that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:36.420
dollar status is not in jeopardy and so that we&nbsp;
can keep on running these huge deficits we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:41.880
create keep on creating inflation and the world's&nbsp;
got no choice right but the state with a dollar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:46.620
because are they going to go to the euro are they&nbsp;
going to go to the Yen you know the pound I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:55.200
they're winning B I agree all of those currencies&nbsp;
also have problems and so do you really want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:55.200 --> 00:52:00.720
switch from one flawed fiat currency to another&nbsp;
even if those other Fiat currencies may be less&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:05.520
flawed than the dollar right do you really&nbsp;
want to make that shift I don't think that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:10.020
that's what's going to happen what everybody&nbsp;
is missing is that there is an alternative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:17.160
to the dollar that doesn't involve another fiat&nbsp;
currency and that's gold that is real money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:24.960
everybody forgets that for thousands of years gold&nbsp;
was money it was money because it worked now over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:31.020
the course of time we had paper currencies that&nbsp;
would arise and fall I mean hundreds of years ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:35.520
they were paper currencies that are now worthless&nbsp;
and you don't even know their names you know they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:42.900
come and go but gold has has stayed you know&nbsp;
gold works as money and so I think what these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:48.600
central banks are going to do is as they get out&nbsp;
of dollars they will just increase their Holdings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:55.980
of gold gold will be the monetary anchor gold will&nbsp;
be the reserve monetary asset just the way it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:55.980 --> 00:53:00.780
before the dollar it wasn't the British pound I&nbsp;
mean the British pound was a dominant currency but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:06.900
gold was what everybody owned the British back the&nbsp;
pound do you see any do you see any evidence that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:13.140
some of these alternate currencies are starting&nbsp;
to back their currency claims with gold oh yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:20.040
you can what's happening on the central banks are&nbsp;
now buying more gold than they've bought in in in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:26.940
decades especially a lot of the uh you know the&nbsp;
Emerging Market countries not even maybe so much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:33.000
the United States isn't buying any gold and maybe&nbsp;
you know some of the more mature uh countries but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:40.800
a lot of other countries that had predominantly&nbsp;
held dollars and then to a lower degree Euros or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:47.280
Yen or pounds these countries are increasingly&nbsp;
buying gold that's why gold is at a record high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:53.220
it goes around two thousand dollars an ounce but&nbsp;
in terms of just about every other currency on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:59.280
the planet gold has been hitting all-time record&nbsp;
highs uh and again that's not really gold going up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:05.520
that's all these Fiat currencies going down but&nbsp;
what are the reasons that countries would want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:11.520
gold as opposed to the dollar is the US government&nbsp;
doesn't have any control over it you know gold is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:16.680
an asset that's not also somebody else's liability&nbsp;
and nobody could create it you have to mine it no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:21.480
one country you know has the advantage so&nbsp;
you know why would you want to take away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:28.320
uh that that privilege that the United States has&nbsp;
and just bestow it on somebody else who is going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:33.480
to abuse it the same way I mean the United States&nbsp;
abused that privilege that we had and we we we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:39.480
exported all this inflation to the world we took&nbsp;
advantage of the this the position that we were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:45.780
in uh so why would you want to put another nation&nbsp;
in in a position to similarly take advantage of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:52.020
the world it's much better to go back to to&nbsp;
honest money and again even when we were on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:58.500
Bretton Woods before you know 1971 and we were on&nbsp;
the dollar standard it was because the dollar was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:04.920
backed by gold again if you held dollars you held&nbsp;
gold that's where the saying came from the dollar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:11.340
is as good as gold in fact the legal definition&nbsp;
of a dollar is a is a weight of gold that's what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:18.060
a dollar is dollars are gold the the the paper&nbsp;
currency that circulated Federal Reserve notes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:23.760
are not dollars they are notes of the Federal&nbsp;
Reserve initially the those Federal Reserve notes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:29.700
were payable in dollars the dollars were the gold&nbsp;
that the Federal Reserve notes paid because if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:34.800
think about what a note is a note is a promise to&nbsp;
pay something a Federal Reserve Note is supposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:41.160
to pay something well what did it pay it paid gold&nbsp;
it paid dollars today Federal Reserve notes pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:46.020
nothing their ious nothing the Federal Reserve&nbsp;
is not obligated to give you anything I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:50.820
if you have a ten dollar bill okay so people&nbsp;
people might object and they and they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:59.100
that well gold is just another arbitrary standard&nbsp;
of value it has some intrinsic worth it's useful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:05.760
for jewelry it's useful for certain industrial&nbsp;
applications but it's just another psychologically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:12.900
valuable currency without any intrinsic value&nbsp;
and so it shouldn't be a repository of value in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:18.780
principle that's any more stable than let's say a&nbsp;
well-managed or even a badly managed fiat currency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:26.220
and so what do you what do you why is it that&nbsp;
gold has proved itself let's say over centuries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:32.820
or Millennia as a storehouse of value what is it&nbsp;
about gold intrinsically let's say that seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:40.380
have given it that edge the idea that gold doesn't&nbsp;
have any intrinsic value is just pure nonsense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:48.300
it's obviously politicians have a vested interest&nbsp;
in in trying to diminish gold as a monetary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:53.400
alternative to the Fiat system and even now you&nbsp;
have a lot out of cryptocurrency enthusiasts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:58.140
who say the same thing well you know gold has no&nbsp;
value because they want to justify something like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:04.260
Bitcoin which also has no value and say well gold&nbsp;
worked as money and it has no value so so Bitcoin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:10.620
could work well it's not true that gold has no&nbsp;
value gold is the most valuable the most useful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:20.820
metal on the periodic table gold became money&nbsp;
because it was such a valuable commodity but gold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:28.560
has a lot of properties that make it uniquely&nbsp;
qualified to be money more so than than other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:36.180
Commodities that's why gold was so successful over&nbsp;
the centuries as money because people preferred to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:42.720
use it as money it wasn't governments that decided&nbsp;
gold is going to be money the people decided that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:47.160
gold was going to be money and once the people&nbsp;
decided that gold was going to be money if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:51.720
were a king you know well you would tax people in&nbsp;
Gold because if you wanted to pay your soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:57.240
to protect you your soldiers wanted gold right&nbsp;
so it was the money created in the free market&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:05.040
and it beat out all other forms of money because&nbsp;
gold you know a gold coin uh all they're all all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:10.920
the same you could melt gold down and you can make&nbsp;
it into coins uh it's fungible it's portable it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:19.560
divisible but the other aspect of goal that is&nbsp;
the key you can save gold because if I have an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:24.480
ounce of gold in 100 years in a thousand years&nbsp;
it's exactly the same it doesn't lose any of its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:30.660
properties and in fact even if I take my gold and&nbsp;
I make you know I make a ring out of it or I I use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:37.260
it to make a watch right you can melt this ring&nbsp;
down and you get your gold back and it's exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:42.720
the way it was you could do something else with it&nbsp;
there's really no other metal you can keep using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:47.100
it over and over and over again I mean they fill&nbsp;
teeth with gold if you find somebody buried in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:51.660
the ground you know you could take their fillings&nbsp;
and you know the Gold's still there you know there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:58.680
treasure ships from the 1400s 1500s they sink if&nbsp;
they recover the wreckage the only thing that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:04.680
still there is the goal it's an it looks exactly&nbsp;
the way it looked when the sink when the ship sank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:11.580
500 years ago so from a point of savings because&nbsp;
money has to satisfy three primary conditions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:17.400
two of them are a unit of account an immediate&nbsp;
exchange but the third one is the store of value&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:24.960
and that's important because it's also makes it&nbsp;
possible to do loans that I can borrow money you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:29.640
can lend money and you can be repaid and you know&nbsp;
that the money that you're going to get repaid is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:35.760
going to retain its value and so that's something&nbsp;
that gold that gold does better than than other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:43.080
metals but the the value of gold even if I'm&nbsp;
not using my gold today as a metal let's say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:47.520
I have gold stored in a safe and you say well you&nbsp;
know you're not using it for anything that's true&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:54.360
but I'm preserving the future use of that gold&nbsp;
somebody in the future is going to need that gold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:59.940
and so I'm storing it right now because you know&nbsp;
there are more uses for gold that are discovered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:05.700
all the time because of its very unique properties&nbsp;
I'm sure in a hundred years or a thousand years&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:12.060
there will be more uses for gold than there&nbsp;
are now and and so okay so let me where are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:19.860
they push you on the crypto front for a second&nbsp;
so so you know I've been contemplating permanent&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:25.500
storage storehouses of value concerned about&nbsp;
such phenomenon that we've been discussing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:31.020
as inflation and potentially hyperinflation Which&nbsp;
is far from rare even among developed countries I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:38.640
think you have a one percent chance if you live in&nbsp;
a developed country of uh hyperinflation incident&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.560
at some point in your life it's something like&nbsp;
that but anyways the cryptocurrency people and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:49.980
I think the Bitcoin people have made this case the&nbsp;
best is that they've managed to duplicate gold in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:54.960
its important elements in that they've produced&nbsp;
a storehouse of value that can't be corrupted&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:59.820
because it's blockchained and distributed and&nbsp;
that's a nice argument that also gets more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:07.920
scarce with time which was quite the brilliant&nbsp;
um technological innovation that requires work to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:16.200
obtain and so that's the Bitcoin mining but&nbsp;
that is also easily distributable digitally and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.820
so it's out of the hands of governments it's&nbsp;
an uncorruptable store of value it's widely&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:28.020
distributed and it's easily moved and so you know&nbsp;
that's not that that accounts for a fair number of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:36.000
the properties that you described a money a moment&nbsp;
a monetary unit had to possess so what do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.460
think of crypto in general but more specifically&nbsp;
about Bitcoin because I think it's king of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:47.880
cryptos and do you think there's a case to be&nbsp;
made that gold has an advantage that crypto&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:53.280
cannot duplicate and then we might ask well what&nbsp;
if you had a gold-backed crypto because maybe then&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:58.320
you could have the best of both worlds so so what&nbsp;
are your thoughts about the I mean bitcoin's done&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.960
pretty well for a currency that doesn't exist you&nbsp;
know that's not government mandated Etc it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:10.500
stored its value there's a lot of well variability&nbsp;
oh first of all but Bitcoin isn't a store value&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:15.660
because you can't store something that you don't&nbsp;
have right first you have to have the value so as&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:21.780
I said Gold's value is its use as a metal right&nbsp;
that's what you're storing is the future use of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:26.520
gold and metal whether you're going to use it in&nbsp;
jewelry or as a conductor in electronics or in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:33.420
medicine whatever it is you're you're storing that&nbsp;
uh Bitcoin only has a price doesn't have value&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:38.520
price is something that you pay right value is&nbsp;
something that you get when you buy Bitcoin you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:44.580
pay a price but you get no real value um and now&nbsp;
I agree the price of Bitcoin has gone way up from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:50.340
when it was first started where you know you could&nbsp;
get multiple Bitcoins for a fraction of a penny&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:55.920
or a dollar whatever they started next to nothing&nbsp;
and at one point people were paying almost seventy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:02.160
thousand dollars for for a Bitcoin um currently&nbsp;
it's around 27 000 as we're recording this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.560
um so depending on when you bought you you&nbsp;
potentially made a lot of money if you sold&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:14.640
if you bought during the Mania hysteria of 2021&nbsp;
you know you you've lost a lot of your money if&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:23.340
you if you get out um but looking at Bitcoin look&nbsp;
Bitcoin did an excellent job of replicating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:31.800
qualities that gold has that made it better money&nbsp;
than you know cattle you know or salt or you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:37.620
other Commodities that have been money right gold&nbsp;
did has certain properties and Bitcoin you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:45.420
captured those properties but the most&nbsp;
important property at all of all is Gold's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:54.420
metallic properties gold as a commodity Bitcoin&nbsp;
has none of that and and so Bitcoin just like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:59.760
fiat currency what what gives a fiat currency&nbsp;
its value just confidence people just believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:05.640
that it has value they believe that people will&nbsp;
accept it now part of that belief is driven by&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:10.920
governments which declare it legal tender and&nbsp;
which require it for payment of taxes and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:16.320
there is some real demand for dollars if you live&nbsp;
in America there's a demand for euros if you're in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.820
Europe because you have to pay taxes and if you&nbsp;
don't pay taxes they could put you in jail and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:26.880
so in order to avoid jail you need the currency&nbsp;
that the the government demands uh but Bitcoin&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:34.860
is similar to Fiat in that all of its value comes&nbsp;
from faith and confidence people just believe that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:40.140
people in the future will want it and they'll pay&nbsp;
a higher price for it except there is no legal&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:46.080
currency status there is no government really&nbsp;
maybe other than El Salvador I don't know what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:51.240
going on over there but there's no government&nbsp;
that is accepting tax payments in Bitcoin&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:55.500
um so there's no natural demand&nbsp;
other than the speculative demand&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.540
from people who think they're going to get rich I&nbsp;
mean people who buy Bitcoin are buying it because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:05.760
they expect the price to go up and the people who&nbsp;
buy it from them thinks their the price is going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:10.200
to go up so it's just greater full theory that the&nbsp;
price is going to go up and that's what's driving&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:17.100
people to buy it uh it's very cumbersome if you&nbsp;
want to use it as a medium exchange or a unit of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:21.900
account it's too volatile to be a unit of account&nbsp;
it's too expensive to be a medium of exchange and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:27.600
it can't be a store of value uh so it's it's&nbsp;
it's not gold it's you know digital Fool's Gold&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:34.440
but you you hit the nail on the head when&nbsp;
you talked about a crypto that's actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:41.640
backed by gold that works that solves&nbsp;
all the problems that bitcoiners claim&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:46.980
gold has it well you know I can't send my&nbsp;
gold around the world I can't use my gold&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:53.640
to buy a cup of coffee well yes you can it's a&nbsp;
lot better than Bitcoin if I have gold stored&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:58.320
with any third party it could be a government it&nbsp;
could be a private company it could be anybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:04.920
you could tokenize that goal and&nbsp;
have a Bitcoin similar cryptocurrency&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:12.720
that is a digital representation of that actual&nbsp;
goal it's like a warehouse receipt an IOU for gold&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:19.620
and then if I wanted to give you some of my gold&nbsp;
I wouldn't have to ship you my bar I could just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:26.100
send you my tokens you know over the internet&nbsp;
and and now the ownership goes from me to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:33.120
um you know it's it's an improvement on paper&nbsp;
money because again initially paper money came&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:38.880
as a substitute for gold I had my gold stored with&nbsp;
a blacksmith and instead of lugging my gold around&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:44.760
my blacksmith gave me an IOU and then I could&nbsp;
circulate that IOU because everybody knows the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:51.240
gold is there and instead of having to get it they&nbsp;
just circulate uh the IOU in in the paper terms&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:58.680
well it's much more efficient to do it uh crypto&nbsp;
digitally and you can take an ounce of gold or a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:06.300
gram of gold and divide it you know to tiny little&nbsp;
pieces so that I could buy a cup of coffee and pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:13.260
the Barista with my gold uh using the token uh&nbsp;
and it would be faster and cheaper than Bitcoin&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:18.720
and the difference is when I'm paying with gold&nbsp;
I'm paying with something real I'm getting one&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:22.440
commodity for another I'm getting coffee and&nbsp;
the guy that sold me coffee is getting gold&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:28.740
um and you can actually denominate the price&nbsp;
in Gold because gold is stable I mean it could&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:34.200
function much better as a monetary instrument&nbsp;
the only thing that you have you have to trust&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:39.660
you have to trust the third party but I mean&nbsp;
capitalism is all about trusting third parties&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:44.640
I mean private third parties we we buy an&nbsp;
insurance policy people buy life insurance&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:50.160
fire Insurance health insurance it's all a third&nbsp;
party that's selling you that policy the policy is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:55.800
only as good as the third party's ability to to&nbsp;
pay you know how do you you know we have rating&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:02.460
agencies we have capitalism we have competition&nbsp;
for reputation there is no reason that you can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:07.800
have third parties to store your gold and then you&nbsp;
could use it you don't have to store all of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.420
gold that way you can keep a lot of your gold&nbsp;
yourself but the goal that you want to use as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:19.980
media of exchange uh you can use that uh digitally&nbsp;
and that works much better uh than Bitcoin you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:25.380
have real value you have real well I've talked&nbsp;
I've talked to people who have attempted to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:31.800
produce gold-backed cryptocurrencies and they've&nbsp;
run into from my understanding a variety of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:37.680
legal impediments on that front do you know of&nbsp;
anybody who's doing that successfully and if so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:44.640
why aren't they uh Prime competitors let's say&nbsp;
in the international market for Bitcoin I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.540
the argument you laid out seems to make sense&nbsp;
and so you'd think well you'd think two things&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:55.320
you'd think given that governments are rushing&nbsp;
to digital currencies and that some governments&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:55.320 --> 01:09:00.600
would like to displace the U.S dollar as&nbsp;
the reserve currency that the logical thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:06.360
to do for some enterprising country would be to&nbsp;
produce a digital currency that was gold backed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:11.820
and so what's happening on that front&nbsp;
okay so there's two things first of all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:19.020
the demand that is mainly coming in&nbsp;
cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:25.920
is to get rich right people want to buy Bitcoin&nbsp;
because they think it's going to go to the Moon&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:33.300
and so that's really the demand for&nbsp;
cryptocurrencies it's not to have an&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:40.380
alternative as a medium of exchange and as a unit&nbsp;
of account most people that are buying Bitcoin&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:46.380
they still use dollars or Euros or Pounds in their&nbsp;
transactions they just hoard their Bitcoin because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:55.020
they think they're going to get rich and and so&nbsp;
there's no real Demand yet for a cryptocurrency&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:55.020 --> 01:10:00.720
that's backed by gold to be used as a medium&nbsp;
exchange people are still content to use their&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:10.320
Fiat currencies for that role um but I think&nbsp;
that once this crypto bubble really pops and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:17.640
the losses you know stack up and and people&nbsp;
get burned and they're no longer interested&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:24.120
in these get rich quick schemes and they&nbsp;
really start to focus on an alternative&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:31.020
not to get rich but to preserve what they have&nbsp;
right because that's what gold is Right physical&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:35.640
gold is not about getting rich it's about&nbsp;
avoiding becoming poor it's about avoiding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:44.040
inflation tax and and so I think as the inflation&nbsp;
rates get worse throughout you know the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:52.920
there will be more of a demand for an alternative&nbsp;
medium of exchange to these Fiat currencies that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:57.780
can also store value you said you said some of&nbsp;
that is happening already you said that many&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:03.660
countries around the world the central banks are&nbsp;
buying gold the central banks right seems to be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:09.900
right right so and and many of those central banks&nbsp;
are also starting to experiment with the idea of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:14.640
an imposed digital currency well there there's&nbsp;
there's flirting on the market what they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:20.160
talking about is a digital fiat currency that&nbsp;
just gives them more yes I know they just want&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:27.000
they and if they want to eliminate cash it's just&nbsp;
inherently a very oppressive monetary system that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.220
concentrates even more power in government&nbsp;
and diminishes uh individual liberty and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:36.960
makes it easier for governments to become more&nbsp;
tyrannical so that's a whole different a topic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:43.200
but staying on a gold back crypto so one reason&nbsp;
is that there's not a lot of demand for it yet&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:51.120
the other problem though is that to the extent&nbsp;
that there is some demand there is such a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:57.300
regulatory impediment and I think it's deliberate&nbsp;
on the part of governments governments don't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:04.800
to have to compete with gold and and so the&nbsp;
barrier that a lot of companies face because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:12.180
it's very easy to tokenize Gold this is not a hard&nbsp;
process it's the regulatory environment it's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:21.120
money laundering laws uh you know that are there&nbsp;
uh that make it very expensive to get into this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:29.820
um business uh because you have to comply with all&nbsp;
these rules and regulations and also you have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:36.060
potential for governments to declare these tokens&nbsp;
Securities which they're not but some government&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:40.860
can say oh it's a it's a security and now it's got&nbsp;
to be registered and you've got to comply with all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:48.600
these other rules and regulations so government&nbsp;
makes it very expensive to compete with their Fiat&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:57.000
currencies so what has to happen is the advantage&nbsp;
of a goal back crypto has to be so large that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.560
could absorb those costs and that's going to&nbsp;
happen because the inflation is going to be so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:07.800
high but also you're going to have Sovereign&nbsp;
Nations potentially coming out with goldback&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:12.780
cryptos in the United States you may have state&nbsp;
governments coming out with their own official&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:20.040
uh gold back uh cryptos uh there it's I mean&nbsp;
all of this is going to happen the market is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:26.040
going to find solutions to this problem you&nbsp;
know whenever the government you know has some&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.960
type of service that it provides and of course&nbsp;
all government services are going to be flawed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:36.060
you know we talked about how capitalism lowers&nbsp;
prices governments raise prices whenever whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:42.360
you look at an industry that that's heavily&nbsp;
regulated education right prices go up all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.920
the time because the government is so involved&nbsp;
that's why it keeps getting more expensive and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:52.560
the quality goes down the quality of Education&nbsp;
I mean a high school degree you know 50 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:58.320
ago is is way more valuable than a college degree&nbsp;
today even a master's degree so governments have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:03.780
destroyed especially a master's degree yeah the&nbsp;
governments have destroyed the value of degrees&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:10.740
while dramatically increasing the price to to get&nbsp;
one so government drives quality down and price up&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:17.280
the free market does the reverse it drives quite&nbsp;
quality up and and and and and and price down&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.940
government let's say the post office right post&nbsp;
office was a problem and so then FedEx came along&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:30.720
right and okay we can avoid the post office or&nbsp;
more recently uh governments create monopolies&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:38.640
in taxi cabs well Uber comes along Lyft comes&nbsp;
along and and creates some competition to these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:45.780
government monopolies so the same thing is going&nbsp;
to happen with money government money is is so bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:53.460
and it's going to get worse that the market is&nbsp;
going to offer Alternatives and yes the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:53.460 --> 01:15:00.900
is going to try to put up roadblocks to protect&nbsp;
its Monopoly But ultimately it won't work and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:07.200
know the people will find ways around it okay&nbsp;
okay so well let's turn on the recommendation&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:12.060
front now so and we can talk a little bit&nbsp;
about your particular business as well so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:18.660
I would say that one of the threads running&nbsp;
through our conversation is well first of all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:23.820
you're cautioning people against the immense&nbsp;
danger not only of inflation but of potential&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:29.400
hyperinflation and you're making the case that&nbsp;
Fiat currencies including the American dollar&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:35.460
are intrinsically weak and getting weaker for a&nbsp;
variety of reasons and that's true systemically&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:42.000
not only in the US and that that's going to&nbsp;
inevitably increase inflationary pressure&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.280
now we've seen a fair bit of that in the last two&nbsp;
years let's say and it's certainly I think evident&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.620
to anyone who's thinking that the actual inflation&nbsp;
rate is much higher than the pronounced inflation&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:57.660
rate okay so now hypothetically people are going&nbsp;
to want to know how to protect themselves against&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:04.320
inflation if they're trying to store wealth in&nbsp;
the long run um trying to maintain their savings&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:12.060
at minimum let's say and you make a strong case&nbsp;
that gold is the proper medium in which to invest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:20.100
savings that you wish to maintain now you broker&nbsp;
gold purchasing Services we can walk through that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:23.760
a little bit and so someone could say well you&nbsp;
know you have an iron in the fire you have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.960
stake and the outcome here it's not surprising&nbsp;
that you're putting forward the pro gold Vision&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:32.580
but I presume the reason you're doing that is&nbsp;
because you actually believe it and are invested&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:38.700
that way yourself so what would you recommend to&nbsp;
people who are listening and these would be people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:46.020
of a moderate income let's say or perhaps on the&nbsp;
Lower Side what would you recommend to them to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:51.060
doing in order to protect themselves against the&nbsp;
threat of inflation as the future rules forward&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:56.160
yeah well first of all absolutely right I don't&nbsp;
I don't promote gold because I have a bunch of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:02.280
gold I'm looking to unload I mean I I went into&nbsp;
that business because I believe that people need&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:10.440
to own it I mean in fact I started shift gold uh&nbsp;
I had I was I owned a broker dealer and a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:15.840
my customers wanted gold because I promoted gold&nbsp;
I talked about it but I didn't I didn't sell it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:20.580
at the time I was was just you know I was stock&nbsp;
broker and I was helping people with their stock&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:25.200
portfolios but I also recommended that they go&nbsp;
and buy some gold and they would go and buy it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:30.060
from other companies but what was happening is&nbsp;
people were getting ripped off a lot of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:36.300
gold Merchants were uh overpricing their products&nbsp;
they were you know pushing them into numismatics&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:41.700
or these Collectibles and I didn't like what&nbsp;
was going on and so in order to make sure that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:46.920
my customers didn't get ripped off I started my&nbsp;
own business to so that they could buy gold from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:51.660
me and I could make sure that they they weren't&nbsp;
pushed into these other products and that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:56.100
bought bullion and they they paid a low price&nbsp;
for it so that's how I got into the business&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:02.280
um because I believed in it now I don't look&nbsp;
at gold though as an investment I look at gold&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:09.360
as money so to the extent that you want to keep&nbsp;
liquidity you don't want to make an investment&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:13.440
right you don't want to buy real estate you don't&nbsp;
want to buy stocks you don't want to buy bonds&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:20.760
you just want to keep some cash that's where I&nbsp;
see gold as a place in the portfolio right and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:25.800
not the cash that you might need I mean at least&nbsp;
now I mean when we're starting to use gold back&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:31.620
crypto then you could keep everything in Gold but&nbsp;
for now you want to pay your rent your landlord&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:36.240
isn't taking gold yet I mean he probably will&nbsp;
in the future but right now he wants you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:41.940
dollars or Euros so you got to keep some cash to&nbsp;
pay your bills but if you're talking about cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:48.060
that you're going to hold on to that you might use&nbsp;
in a few years maybe to make an investment maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:52.380
you think real estate's going to go down maybe you&nbsp;
think stocks are going to go down and so you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:58.080
to you want to have some dry powder to buy that's&nbsp;
where you want to keep gold instead of currency&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:04.260
because currency could lose so much value that&nbsp;
you know stocks can go down in value but still&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:11.160
go up in price you know so let's say uh stocks&nbsp;
could go down 10 or 20 percent in terms of gold&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:18.300
but they can go up in terms of dollars or or or&nbsp;
Euros so it's better to hold your dry powder in in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:23.880
honest money and especially now because if you&nbsp;
look around the world interest rates in almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:28.380
every country are still below the official&nbsp;
inflation rates which means rates are negative&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:33.660
and of course the the real inflation rates are&nbsp;
much higher than the official rates so you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:40.020
losing a lot in cash maybe 10 20 years ago that&nbsp;
wasn't the case you could get an interest rate&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:45.780
that exceeded the rate of inflation and so you&nbsp;
were paid for the loss of uh purchasing power&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:50.580
and people would say hey you don't want to own&nbsp;
gold because you're giving up that interest well&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:55.680
now there is no interest there's negative&nbsp;
interest gold actually lets you avoid that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:00.780
negative interest because negative interest is a&nbsp;
loss that's imposed On You by holding a currency&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:08.760
so you avoid that loss by owning gold so gold&nbsp;
uh is a substitute for money but you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:13.080
make investments you don't want to just leave all&nbsp;
your money in gold gold is a metal it's not doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:19.560
anything it's not producing anything uh you're&nbsp;
gonna do better over time investing in productive&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:26.460
assets and that's what I do if you can identify&nbsp;
them yes and if you don't overpay for them I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:30.780
mean that's a mistake that a lot of people make&nbsp;
they look at a company that has a good product&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:37.980
and they think oh it let me buy that stock&nbsp;
well the stock could be way overpriced so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:44.220
it's not just buying a good company it's paying&nbsp;
the right price and because that's what's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:49.980
to determine your long-term return if you overpay&nbsp;
for an asset you're probably going to lose money&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:55.440
eventually now you can so how would you how do&nbsp;
you view how do you view let's say the relative&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.420
importance of something like a good so there&nbsp;
are these funds which I'll just outline this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:05.160
for people who are listening that allow you&nbsp;
to purchase a basket of stocks essentially&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:13.080
and often those stocks are weighted to the index&nbsp;
is used to assess stock market performance and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:21.180
you can buy uh shares in a mutual fund in a fund&nbsp;
let's say that owns a basket of stocks a large&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:27.300
basket of stocks and so then you average your risk&nbsp;
across many companies and you benefit in principle&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:33.960
from the average increase in productivity across&nbsp;
that basket of Stellar companies and so those&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:41.160
those index portfolios have proved to be a pretty&nbsp;
good alternative to actively managed money and how&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:47.520
do you see investing in gold in relationship to&nbsp;
something like investing in an index fund well I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:53.460
mean they're very different so first of all the&nbsp;
the idea of just indexing and just say look I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:58.560
just going to buy the market I'm going to buy&nbsp;
all these stocks you know in certain periods&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:04.260
of time that could work out right because if a&nbsp;
lot of money is flowing into those indexes it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:09.060
going to push up the price of the stocks that&nbsp;
are included in those indexes but right now&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:17.280
because so many people have indexed the stocks&nbsp;
in those indexes by and large are overpriced&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:22.980
and if you you buy if you overpay for an asset as&nbsp;
I said you're going to lose eventually now you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:27.600
overpay for an asset and you can make money&nbsp;
if you can sell it to somebody who overpays&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:33.360
by an even greater amount and so you could trade&nbsp;
overpriced assets if you're Nimble and make money&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:39.240
but if you're a long-term investor the way to make&nbsp;
money is to buy something cheap buy it when it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:44.400
undervalued especially if it pays a good dividend&nbsp;
because now you can collect your dividends while&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:51.060
you're waiting for the asset that you bought&nbsp;
cheap to become expensive and I don't like passive&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:55.860
investing you know what I do for my clients&nbsp;
and what I do personally is I actively invest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:03.660
um and over the long run that is much better&nbsp;
than indexing over certain periods of time&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:12.420
indexing can do better and then it becomes a&nbsp;
self-fulfilling prophecy because the money gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:18.300
sucked in chasing and performance how how do you&nbsp;
know that you're how do you know that your active&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:24.480
investing is allowing you to I accurately identify&nbsp;
stocks that are properly or under underpriced I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:32.760
mean that's the million dollar question well there&nbsp;
are some basic you know truths to assessing value&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:37.740
of a business right you could look at a a business&nbsp;
because that's what a stock is when you're buying&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:43.320
a stock you're buying a piece of a business so&nbsp;
you look at the business and you can look at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:50.880
the revenues the profits the debt you know you&nbsp;
could look at all these metrics and you can tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:58.860
you know is it cheap am I buying the income&nbsp;
potential of this business am I getting a good&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:04.980
price you can look at ratios historically that&nbsp;
show you that something is cheap or expensive&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:11.400
now the problem that a lot of people have is&nbsp;
their time Horizons are so short because yes an&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:18.060
asset can stay cheap for a while before the price&nbsp;
goes up and usually when you get something cheap&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:23.880
it's because there's a problem something's got&nbsp;
to be going wrong that's causing people to sell&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:30.480
so what you have to be able to do is do your&nbsp;
homework and decide is this problem that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:37.320
hurting the price of this stock is it fixable is&nbsp;
it long term can we see beyond this problem to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:42.720
solution and is the market getting something&nbsp;
wrong and I'm getting a good price conversely&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:48.360
when stocks are expensive it's because they're&nbsp;
doing great and everybody loves them and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:53.160
what you have to decide is well are people being&nbsp;
too optimistic about this company that's doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:58.620
really well are there problems that the market&nbsp;
is not paying attention to that are likely to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:05.100
come up in several years so there are ways to&nbsp;
do this and if you're smart and you st you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:12.720
basic principles over the long run I think you're&nbsp;
going to outperform just a static basket of stocks&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:17.220
where you're just going to pay whatever price the&nbsp;
market is demanding I mean people say well you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:23.520
saying that's partly because these index stocks&nbsp;
they also tend to be somewhat inflated in value&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:27.900
because so many people have dumped money into&nbsp;
them exactly that's artificially inflating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:33.540
price of the entire basket right right because&nbsp;
then that counter purposes to the idea of random&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:38.580
sampling it's no longer random if you're buying a&nbsp;
preferentially priced basket and then it's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:43.980
to work in Reverse when a lot of people want to&nbsp;
get out of the indexes all these stocks are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:48.900
to get sold because a lot of these stocks don't&nbsp;
even pay dividends I mean the problem is let's say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:55.020
you're buying a bunch of stocks they don't pay&nbsp;
dividends if you retire and you have all these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:59.160
stocks and now you need money to pay your bills&nbsp;
because you don't have a job you got to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:05.700
selling your stocks and that puts downward&nbsp;
pressure so by by placing those stocks in an&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:11.400
index they're no longer independent either right&nbsp;
you bundle them together and so the presumption&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.720
of Independence that was there to begin with&nbsp;
is violated by the bundling of the stocks in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:21.600
the index but the other point I'm trying to make&nbsp;
is if I'm building a portfolio for my clients of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:26.280
companies that I'm buying cheap and because I'm&nbsp;
buying them cheap I'm getting a high dividend I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:30.960
getting a lot of income on my stock because see if&nbsp;
you're just buying a stock because you think the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:35.760
price is going to go up that's just speculating&nbsp;
you could be wrong the price could go down I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:41.640
buying stocks that even if the price never goes up&nbsp;
I still make a good return because I'm getting a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:46.800
dividend right now regardless of what happens to&nbsp;
the stock price so if you build a big portfolio&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:52.200
of good dividend-paying stocks while you're still&nbsp;
working and you don't need the income you can take&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:57.780
those dividends and buy more stocks and build&nbsp;
up your portfolio but then when you retire you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:02.580
don't have to sell your stocks you just take your&nbsp;
checks your dividends and you start spending those&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:09.060
you stop reinvesting and so that's not a Ponzi&nbsp;
mentality that's legitimate investing in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:14.700
market uh by buying companies that throw the most&nbsp;
important thing though that I think people can do&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:20.460
now is recognize though if I'm right about what's&nbsp;
going to happen to the dollar and the US economy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:28.680
the companies I'm buying are international and&nbsp;
their customers are outside the United States&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:34.920
and these are the customers that are going to&nbsp;
benefit when the dollar declines and the U.S loses&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:40.440
that Reserve status and Americans can no longer&nbsp;
live above above their means that means a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:45.300
other people who are living beneath their means&nbsp;
they're going to get a reward from the dollars&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:52.680
a loss of status and those consumers in those&nbsp;
other countries are now going to be in better&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:58.860
shape I want to own businesses that have those&nbsp;
customers I want businesses whose customers are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:04.080
going to get richer not whose customers are going&nbsp;
to get poor and I want customers who have a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:11.040
of savings not a lot of debt so I own businesses&nbsp;
that are going to be able to thrive in an econ you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:17.760
know where the US economy is in a lot of trouble&nbsp;
where it's in stagflation and I also own companies&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:24.060
that sell products and provide services that&nbsp;
people need and they're going to continue to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:29.460
buy those goods and services even if they have to&nbsp;
cut back on other things to afford it you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:34.800
want to have a portfolio where consumers&nbsp;
can easily do without what you're selling&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:40.140
or if you're not even selling anything a lot of&nbsp;
these tech companies you know all their income&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:45.300
is from advertising they give away the products&nbsp;
and they and they have advertisers but if the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:49.800
consumers can't afford to buy products that&nbsp;
the advertisers are advertising then all that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:55.080
ad Revenue goes away and a lot of these uh tech&nbsp;
companies that have these really high multiples&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:55.080 --> 01:29:02.580
you know they're going to come crashing down okay&nbsp;
so if you were we're starting to come to near the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:08.640
end of the time for our discussion if you were&nbsp;
giving people advice who are beginning to invest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:15.060
let's say these are people who might say have a&nbsp;
hundred to five thousand dollars a month to invest

01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:23.760
what would you recommend when do you think people&nbsp;
should start doing that when should at what level&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.600
of income should you start to consider putting&nbsp;
away some of your money how much should you put&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:32.940
away and then what concrete steps could you&nbsp;
take to start doing this it's broken down in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:37.560
a very simple manner because lots of people have&nbsp;
no idea how to start doing this when it comes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:43.800
investing I mean the earlier you start the better&nbsp;
because you get the compounding effects of that uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:50.820
now if you allow inflation to destroy the value of&nbsp;
what you've invested then you know that's no good&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:57.600
but if somebody only has you know 500 a thousand&nbsp;
dollars a month to invest I mean what I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:05.280
recommend is that they use my mutual funds I mean&nbsp;
you could go to uh my my uh website europac.com&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:11.280
now I think the minimum is twenty five hundred&nbsp;
dollars to get your account going right so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:14.820
have to have at least that amount that's not a&nbsp;
lot but you can go on my website and just buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:19.440
my funds now my funds are also available at all&nbsp;
the discount brokers so if you have an account&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:26.580
at Schwab or Fidelity or Ameritrade or yeah all&nbsp;
these you know my funds are on their platforms&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:33.600
but um but then the I think the the incremental&nbsp;
investment you can invest a hundred dollars or&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:39.780
500 at a time you know you can you can have&nbsp;
small Investments once you've established uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:45.660
the portfolio but then you do get the benefit&nbsp;
of professional management and diversification&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:51.840
you get a a big portfolio of stocks that are&nbsp;
actively managed by by me and my team where&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:58.260
we are you know looking for good opportunities&nbsp;
buying stocks when they're cheap selling them&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:04.740
if they get too expensive um you know constantly&nbsp;
you know you know evaluating our Holdings making&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:10.860
sure that the stocks that we thought were cheap&nbsp;
um because they had a problem that those problems&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:16.020
are being solved and that we're right on our&nbsp;
research and if something comes up and we think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:21.960
we've made a mistake we can sell a stock and and&nbsp;
redeploy the money or if we find an opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:26.400
that we like better than one that we have we&nbsp;
can you know we can make the changes that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:33.600
something that you can't do when you're just&nbsp;
in a in a in a static model you know and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:39.360
that's why my my funds the performance has been&nbsp;
so fantastic recently uh in the last you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:45.120
one three and five years relative our to our&nbsp;
peers is because we've done such a good job of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:51.240
um stock picking and sector allocation I mean&nbsp;
not only are we way ahead of our benchmarks which&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:56.820
would be an index but we're way ahead of everybody&nbsp;
else who's trying to beat the indexes uh but I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:56.820 --> 01:32:03.240
think the the time period where my funds are going&nbsp;
to do the best and I have a value fund a dividend&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:10.620
payer fund an emerging market fund a gold fund and&nbsp;
an international bond fund it's going to be in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:15.600
future years when the dollar is really weakening&nbsp;
I mean the dollar hasn't weakened dramatically yet&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:20.100
I mean in terms of purchasing power it has I mean&nbsp;
that's clear I mean you need more dollars to buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:26.820
everything but in terms of Euros or Yen or pounds&nbsp;
that's not the case but that's coming I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:31.740
we're going to see a substantial decline in the&nbsp;
dollar relative these other currencies and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:37.440
is the environment where my funds are going to do&nbsp;
the best and as inflation rates pick up and we see&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:44.100
a bigger increases in commodity prices uh that's&nbsp;
going to really benefit my investment strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:51.120
so okay so let's let's close with this perhaps so&nbsp;
the devil to some degree is always in time frame&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:57.840
you know and you've made a case for the inevitable&nbsp;
weakening of the American dollar as a reserve&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:03.300
currency and of its value as a fiat currency and&nbsp;
that's in keeping the latter part in particular in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:11.040
keeping with its gradual dissent into comparative&nbsp;
lack of value against gold since 1971. but so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:19.980
the devil is always timing and so over what&nbsp;
period of time do you think this unfolding&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:26.100
into a more inflationary period is going to occur&nbsp;
and and what makes you reasonably convinced let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:32.280
say of your timing well timing is is always&nbsp;
difficult I um I mean I know what's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:37.500
to happen I've known what's going to happen for a&nbsp;
long time right that that might be the problem but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:45.840
where we are right now is exactly where I've been&nbsp;
forecasting we would be even going back to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:50.760
know my predictions of the 2008 financial crisis&nbsp;
you know I knew that crisis was coming because I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:55.920
understood the mistakes that the Federal Reserve&nbsp;
made to create that housing bubble and I knew the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:02.100
consequences for the financial set system when it&nbsp;
popped but even before the bubble popped I knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:07.260
the mistakes the government was going to make I&nbsp;
I predicted QE before I even knew the word I knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:12.960
they would do this and I knew they would inflate&nbsp;
an even bigger bubble uh that has finally popped&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:18.360
because I knew that eventually the FED would be&nbsp;
in a position at other central banks where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:24.120
they would have created so much inflation that&nbsp;
they would now be under pressure to do something&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:28.680
about the inflation problem but they couldn't&nbsp;
do that without creating a worse financial&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:35.700
crisis than the one that they used inflation to&nbsp;
mitigate in 2008 and that financial crisis has&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:40.980
already started we saw that with the failure of&nbsp;
Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:45.840
more Banks would have already failed had they not&nbsp;
been bailed out the government Pat you know came&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:51.120
in and propped them up and printed more money and&nbsp;
and came to the rescue which is another mistake&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:57.900
but we're at a point now where inflation is going&nbsp;
to start to run out of control because the FED&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:05.400
has started to return to inflationary monetary&nbsp;
policies when inflation is already you know triple&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:12.840
it's two percent Target uh we're starting another&nbsp;
recession uh from the weakest you know financial&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:20.160
position that we've ever been in and all the stuff&nbsp;
that's been happening is stuff that I predicted in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:27.000
fact even when covet first started and everybody&nbsp;
was saying oh this is very deflationary I said no&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:32.640
it's not it's massively inflationary because we're&nbsp;
people are not working they're not producing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:37.440
we're printing even more money than ever we're&nbsp;
we're we're actually paying people more to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:41.880
home than they earned when they actually were&nbsp;
productive I said this is you know creating even&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:49.020
more inflation and so we're at this taking point&nbsp;
you know and in fact when the central banks had to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:53.700
keep interest rates at zero for so long they did&nbsp;
that for a reason that was because they didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:58.080
want the whole thing imploding so they kept it&nbsp;
on life support until they couldn't do it anymore&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:04.980
because of the the outbreaks of consumer prices&nbsp;
but I I think we've passed that point and and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:10.080
this is happening this is the time frame where the&nbsp;
air is coming out of this bubble it's still early&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:18.180
if you remember in 2007 when the subprime market&nbsp;
blew up and I was very you know active there we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:23.220
had shorted a subprime market I mean you know they&nbsp;
they you know they made wrote a book they made a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:28.620
movie about that trade well I lived that trade&nbsp;
we did that trade so I I was predicting you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:34.500
subprime I mean you can go one of my videos on&nbsp;
YouTube is mortgage Banker speech I gave in 2006&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:40.620
in front of 3 000 Mortgage Bankers I went there to&nbsp;
promote this hedge fund that was shorting subprime&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:46.260
but you could still watch my my talk with what&nbsp;
you don't have on the Internet is the smaller&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:51.360
talk that I gave later specifically on that fund&nbsp;
right this was the larger talk I had about maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:51.360 --> 01:37:01.500
50 people that came to the smaller presentation&nbsp;
about about the fun um but I knew at at that time&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:11.700
that the the bursting of that bubble but you&nbsp;
know we we would create this crisis but when&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:16.620
the subprime problem initially reared its head&nbsp;
everybody said don't worry about it the Federal&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:22.020
Reserve said it was contained Ben Bernanke said&nbsp;
don't worry about subprime it's contained well I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:26.580
was on television at that time all the time I&nbsp;
used to be on cable news every week back then&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:31.980
I said no it's not contained this is the tip of&nbsp;
an iceberg this is a huge problem in the entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:36.960
mortgage Market we're headed for a financial&nbsp;
crisis you know it's anything but contained&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:42.840
well the government got that wrong then when&nbsp;
inflation really burst out as far as high prices&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:49.380
in 2021 what did they say oh don't worry about&nbsp;
it it's transitory right well I said no it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:54.180
transitory it's permanent it's here to stay they&nbsp;
were wrong again well they're ignoring the warning&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:54.180 --> 01:38:01.260
signs again just like they ignored uh the subprime&nbsp;
problem just like they ignored the outbreak of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:06.960
CPI they're ignoring all the early warning signs&nbsp;
of the of the financial crisis that we're in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:13.620
now and the Great Recession that's beginning&nbsp;
that is much worse than the last one and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:19.020
that the significant thing is going to be the&nbsp;
difference because I think this time we're headed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:24.840
for a currency crisis that's going to be the end&nbsp;
result of this next collapse is going to be the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:30.480
end of the dollar status in a currency crisis and&nbsp;
so you have to have a very different Investment&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:36.120
Portfolio than the one you had in the prior decade&nbsp;
just hiding out in tech stocks isn't going to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:41.400
those stocks are going to go down you have to have&nbsp;
the international value the dividend paying the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:48.300
commodity exposure old-fashioned type investing&nbsp;
gold and and that's what I'm doing and again&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:53.700
for for wealthier people you don't necessarily&nbsp;
have to buy my funds you can buy my funds but we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:59.460
have separately managed accounts so if you contact&nbsp;
your Pacific Asset Management we manage portfolios&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:07.500
individual portfolios of stocks uh that I think&nbsp;
will perform extremely well during the economic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:12.540
environment that we're in and that we're going to&nbsp;
continue to be in most people unfortunately are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:17.340
going to get wiped out people are going to lose&nbsp;
lot in this environment but there's going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:23.520
a small percentage of people there always are who&nbsp;
will make money during this time period And I I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:28.620
just prefer to be among those people right just&nbsp;
like you know not everybody made money off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:34.380
subprime collapse there were a a number of people&nbsp;
who understood the problem and bet against the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:39.300
conventional wisdom and and and they made money&nbsp;
and the conventional wisdom is generally wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:43.800
and it's wrong right now they expect things to&nbsp;
happen and aren't going to happen they have a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:49.080
of confidence and faith in central banks and the&nbsp;
fed and and they're wrong this is not going to end&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:54.780
the way they believe there is a huge mispricing&nbsp;
of Assets Now just like there was for mortgages&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:59.280
back then a lot of people don't understand&nbsp;
this and they're going to suffer but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:04.860
people who understand it are going to are going&nbsp;
to profit and and I'm hoping that as many people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:11.340
as possible I can help them profit by by getting&nbsp;
them properly positioned with their portfolios&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:16.740
all right well that's an excellent place to stop&nbsp;
I would say we're pretty much right on time there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:21.840
and so for everybody who's watching and listening&nbsp;
thank you very much for your time and attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:26.400
and Peter Schiff thank you very much for talking&nbsp;
to me today and walking me through a lot of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:30.900
somewhat Elementary material but it's very&nbsp;
good for people to hear exactly how these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:35.640
things work right because we're not well taught&nbsp;
on the financial front and many of the terms&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:41.760
that are bandied about inflation debt deficit&nbsp;
investment for that matter gold standard Fiat&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:45.840
people don't understand these things and to&nbsp;
be to provide people with that information is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:53.040
extremely helpful we will link to all of the&nbsp;
um opportunities that Peter described in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:57.600
description of the video so you can check that&nbsp;
out if you want and I'm going to switch over to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:03.060
the Daily wire plus side now and talk to Peter&nbsp;
for another half an hour I do that with all my&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:07.080
guests to get a little bit more biographical&nbsp;
information to find out how we got where he&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:13.800
is and uh maybe to delve a bit more deeply into&nbsp;
his ability to have prognosticated accurately&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:20.280
regarding the 2008 financial crisis which was&nbsp;
quite the interesting catastrophe in which he&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:24.540
seemed to get right when very few people did so&nbsp;
for all of you who are watching and listening&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:29.460
um maybe you can direct your interest to the&nbsp;
Daily wire plus side and offer them some support&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:34.920
