so this was a quandary for the
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.550 align:start position:0%
so this was a quandary for the
biologists<00:00:17.119><c> so</c><00:00:17.279><c> they</c><00:00:17.440><c> did</c><00:00:17.600><c> one</c><00:00:17.840><c> of</c><00:00:17.920><c> two</c><00:00:18.160><c> things</c>

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 align:start position:0%

there's the old idea that lions and

they don't they take down the

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
identifiable animals so that's the thing
 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.830 align:start position:0%
identifiable animals so that's the thing
is<00:00:41.760><c> if</c><00:00:41.840><c> you</c><00:00:42.000><c> stick</c><00:00:42.320><c> your</c><00:00:42.480><c> damn</c><00:00:42.800><c> head</c><00:00:43.120><c> up</c><00:00:43.680><c> you</c>

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
is if you stick your damn head up you
 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.069 align:start position:0%
is if you stick your damn head up you
get<00:00:44.079><c> picked</c><00:00:44.399><c> off</c><00:00:44.559><c> by</c><00:00:44.719><c> the</c><00:00:44.879><c> predators</c><00:00:45.440><c> and</c><00:00:45.520><c> so</c>

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
get picked off by the predators and so
