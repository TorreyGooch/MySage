00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
finessed uh the right way I mean I
 

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.270 align:start position:0%
finessed uh the right way I mean I
wasn't<00:37:19.880><c> there</c><00:37:20.200><c> but</c><00:37:20.440><c> you</c><00:37:20.560><c> know</c><00:37:21.119><c> went</c><00:37:21.319><c> down</c><00:37:22.119><c> and</c>

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't there but you know went down and
 

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.430 align:start position:0%
wasn't there but you know went down and

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
then also it's I think he delegated a
 

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.630 align:start position:0%
then also it's I think he delegated a

what<01:10:27.840><c> I</c><01:10:27.920><c> mean</c><01:10:28.280><c> so</c><01:10:28.600><c> in</c><01:10:28.760><c> the</c><01:10:29.239><c> scientific</c>

01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
what I mean so in the scientific
 

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.669 align:start position:0%
what I mean so in the scientific

01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
measure of quality the best predictor is
 

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.550 align:start position:0%
measure of quality the best predictor is
quantity<01:10:41.840><c> right</c><01:10:42.040><c> so</c><01:10:42.440><c> there's</c><01:10:42.640><c> a</c><01:10:42.840><c> real</c><01:10:43.120><c> tight</c>

01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
quantity right so there's a real tight
 

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.790 align:start position:0%
quantity right so there's a real tight

01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
relationship it's very difficult to do
 

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.709 align:start position:0%

that's<01:10:49.520><c> true</c><01:10:49.920><c> if</c><01:10:50.000><c> you</c><01:10:50.400><c> a</c><01:10:50.480><c> lot</c><01:10:50.560><c> of</c><01:10:50.640><c> them</c><01:10:50.719><c> are</c>
