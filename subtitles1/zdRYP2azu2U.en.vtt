and so all you have in a situation like
 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.590 align:start position:0%
and so all you have in a situation like
that<00:01:16.720><c> is</c><00:01:16.960><c> what</c><00:01:17.680><c> is</c><00:01:17.840><c> the</c><00:01:18.000><c> truth</c><00:01:18.720><c> now</c><00:01:19.119><c> you</c><00:01:19.200><c> know</c>

that is what is the truth now you know
of<00:01:19.680><c> course</c><00:01:19.920><c> you</c><00:01:20.159><c> only</c><00:01:20.400><c> have</c><00:01:20.560><c> your</c>

of course you only have your
 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.190 align:start position:0%
of course you only have your

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
approximations to the truth but that's
 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.830 align:start position:0%
approximations to the truth but that's
better<00:01:23.439><c> than</c><00:01:23.680><c> nothing</c><00:01:24.560><c> and</c><00:01:24.720><c> so</c><00:01:25.360><c> you</c><00:01:25.520><c> need</c><00:01:25.680><c> to</c>

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
better than nothing and so you need to
 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.990 align:start position:0%
better than nothing and so you need to
be<00:01:26.000><c> afraid</c><00:01:26.320><c> of</c><00:01:26.400><c> the</c><00:01:26.560><c> right</c><00:01:26.880><c> thing</c><00:01:27.280><c> and</c><00:01:27.840><c> you</c>
