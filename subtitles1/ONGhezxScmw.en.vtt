00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
can understand why you guys are doing it
 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.749 align:start position:0%
can understand why you guys are doing it

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 align:start position:0%
commercially because as you said you
 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.909 align:start position:0%
commercially because as you said you
can't<00:04:41.000><c> afford</c><00:04:41.320><c> the</c><00:04:41.479><c> delay</c><00:04:42.240><c> and</c><00:04:42.440><c> fair</c><00:04:42.919><c> enough</c>

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
can't afford the delay and fair enough
 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.270 align:start position:0%
can't afford the delay and fair enough
okay<00:04:44.080><c> so</c><00:04:44.240><c> now</c><00:04:44.400><c> do</c><00:04:44.520><c> you</c><00:04:44.680><c> have</c><00:04:44.840><c> a</c><00:04:45.039><c> stable</c><00:04:45.440><c> Supply</c>

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
do with yellow cake is what once it's

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.510 align:start position:0%

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
process is that you it's easier to
 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.710 align:start position:0%
process is that you it's easier to
enrich<00:05:29.039><c> a</c><00:05:29.319><c> gas</c>

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
enrich a gas
 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.029 align:start position:0%
enrich a gas
um<00:05:31.720><c> uh</c><00:05:31.919><c> then</c><00:05:32.080><c> it</c><00:05:32.240><c> is</c><00:05:32.600><c> say</c><00:05:33.240><c> say</c><00:05:33.440><c> yellow</c><00:05:33.759><c> cake</c>

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
um uh then it is say say yellow cake
 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.909 align:start position:0%
um uh then it is say say yellow cake
which<00:05:34.440><c> which</c><00:05:34.639><c> you</c><00:05:34.759><c> could</c><00:05:34.919><c> use</c><00:05:35.080><c> a</c><00:05:35.199><c> centrifugal</c>

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
which which you could use a centrifugal
 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.909 align:start position:0%
which which you could use a centrifugal
system<00:05:36.440><c> but</c><00:05:37.600><c> um</c><00:05:38.600><c> but</c><00:05:38.800><c> gas</c><00:05:39.000><c> is</c><00:05:39.120><c> certainly</c><00:05:39.720><c> lot</c>

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
system but um but gas is certainly lot
 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.710 align:start position:0%
system but um but gas is certainly lot

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
easier to maneuver and so um if you
 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.510 align:start position:0%
easier to maneuver and so um if you
would<00:05:43.919><c> take</c><00:05:44.120><c> the</c><00:05:44.240><c> yellow</c><00:05:44.560><c> cake</c><00:05:44.759><c> and</c><00:05:44.919><c> you</c><00:05:45.000><c> would</c>

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
would take the yellow cake and you would
 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.390 align:start position:0%
would take the yellow cake and you would

to turn it into uranium hexafluoride and
 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.150 align:start position:0%
to turn it into uranium hexafluoride and
it's<00:05:52.319><c> actually</c><00:05:52.639><c> the</c><00:05:52.759><c> enrichment</c><00:05:53.319><c> companies</c>

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's actually the enrichment companies
 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.950 align:start position:0%
it's actually the enrichment companies
will<00:05:54.560><c> enrich</c><00:05:55.039><c> uranium</c><00:05:55.800><c> hexl</c><00:05:56.800><c> to</c><00:05:57.080><c> produce</c><00:05:57.960><c> um</c>
