00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
fully developed in some sense and so
 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.630 align:start position:0%
fully developed in some sense and so
that<00:00:30.240><c> just</c><00:00:30.400><c> doesn't</c><00:00:30.759><c> I</c><00:00:30.960><c> that</c><00:00:31.160><c> theory</c><00:00:31.480><c> just</c>

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't I that theory just
 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.310 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't I that theory just
doesn't<00:00:31.880><c> go</c><00:00:32.040><c> anywhere</c><00:00:32.360><c> with</c><00:00:32.520><c> me</c><00:00:32.759><c> I</c><00:00:32.920><c> just</c><00:00:33.079><c> can't</c>

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't go anywhere with me I just can't
 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.150 align:start position:0%
doesn't go anywhere with me I just can't
see<00:00:33.640><c> that</c><00:00:33.800><c> as</c><00:00:33.960><c> useful</c><00:00:34.399><c> at</c><00:00:34.640><c> all</c>

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
see that as useful at all
 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.910 align:start position:0%
see that as useful at all
and<00:00:37.160><c> so</c><00:00:37.440><c> so</c><00:00:37.640><c> I'm</c><00:00:37.760><c> more</c><00:00:38.079><c> likely</c><00:00:38.360><c> to</c><00:00:38.559><c> take</c><00:00:38.760><c> the</c>

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
and so so I'm more likely to take the
 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.790 align:start position:0%
and so so I'm more likely to take the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
