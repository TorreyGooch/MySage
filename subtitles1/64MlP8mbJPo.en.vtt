00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:02.489
Dr.. Jordan Pearson good morning good morning

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.240
Thank you so much for coming in you're developing this enormous power and reach is it the heavy burden for it?

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.000
Well it it's heavy and light at the same time. You know it's it's constant I

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.599
Don't know what I'm doing day-to-day until that day

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.569
I have people managing my schedule, and I'm busy enough so that I pretty much attend to the next thing

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.990
But the responsibility of getting into all these heads mm-hmm

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.539
And you are influencing people's signa me aren't you?

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.170
well

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.239
I guess I take solace in the fact that so many thousands of people now have written to me and also talked to me

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.020
to say that

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.399
Things are better for them because they've been trying to do some of the things that I suggest in my lectures and so

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.539
It is a heavy responsibility

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:52.529
When when you have influence of that sort but it lightens it when you also have evidence

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.128
Suggesting that it seems to be doing people a lot of good your changing lives

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.070
That seems to be the case.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.920
You're saving lives?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.150
Saving lives too? Well, I would say there were six people in the audience last night. I was talking in Melbourne

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.709
I would say there were six, maybe there were more but there were at least six so half a dozen

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:14.860
And they were young men who told me that that that's that's what they said

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.540
That you had served their lives.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.540
Yeah, how do you feel about that?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.430
Breaks me up. Why, it's a very positive thing you've done. What what do you mean it breaks you up?

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.329
Well it's sad that there are so many people in that

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.008
State of crisis you know and they don't need

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.610
that much encouragement

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.950
That's the thing.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.280
So,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.329
It's sad that it only takes that much encouragement to make that much difference. There's a lot of lost people in the world

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.400
 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.360
So it's a good thing to be able to help that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.820
It's overwhelming. Well I can tell that you're very emotional about it.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.260
Yeah, well it's really something. You know what time I hadn't thought much about what had happened last night, but you know

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.740
probably 500 people lined up after the talk and

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.370
Most of them say the same thing you know about a quarter of them say look you're putting into words things

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.640
I already knew I always knew but I didn't know how to say just like oh

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.269
That's what archetypal stories do and and I guess that's what articulate people

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.429
Do you know so that's a good thing, but then the other 3/4 of them say some variant of?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.930
of

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.570
You know my life has been turned around

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.969
They say I was addicted or I was drinking too much, or I wasn't moving ahead my relationship with my girlfriend

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.179
I wasn't getting along with my family. I didn't have any direction in life

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.280
I was nihilistic or hopeless or anxious or any number of variants of those and

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.600
I've been trying to put into practice what you've been talking about in your YouTube lectures and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.520
podcasts and and

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.350
It's really helped my turn my life around. Thank you. It's like

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.140
Yeah

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.989
Do something you feel fragile about that

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.340
Well

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.489
No, I wouldn't say exactly that um I seem to be able to handle this

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.189
It's been going on a long time now. It's it's been 18 months, and I would say in many ways now

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.589
It's better than it was because at the beginning

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.429
Especially when I got when I put my hat in the political ring

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.510
Let's say because I felt that the Canadian politicians had overstepped their boundaries

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.289
You know my job was threatened and

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.029
quite severely, and I thought I might lose my clinical license as well and

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.720
Things were up in the air in a big way.  This was over the gender pronoun usage.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.060
Yeah was my refusal when I stated refusal to abide by the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.660
by the requirement that that I

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.369
modified my language in a certain manner that I

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.950
Felt was you know appropriate

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.469
oh
I felt it was inappropriate of the government to demand that I modify my language the government has no right to

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.840
Intrude on people's lives to that degree

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:09.310
It's very very dangerous when that happens and so anyways there was I've been in one scandal after another in Canada like seriously like

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.540
Non-stop for 18 months the last one. Just two days ago. I was at Queen's University in Kingston, and there was a big

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.140
Demonstration there was a very eerie

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.140
Occurrence they arrested a woman who was carrying a garrote for God's sake you know.  Does that frighten you?

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.980
That was not good, the Queen's University thing was not good. We were in a hall. It was kind of like a church this

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.069
this Hall. It's what it looked like it was lined with stained glass windows and

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.800
probably 20 of them and there was a

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.119
Protester had climbed up in the window well of all 20 windows

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.159
probably five or six feet off the ground and there were seven feet high these windows and they were pounding on them and

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.680
Forcefully forcefully enough in one case to break the window and so there was 900 of us inside

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.939
and it was we were surrounded by this group that were pounding on the windows and yelling and pounding on the doors and

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.480
It was and you know you could see against the stained glass you could see these shadowy forms pounding away

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.640
And it was it was very eerie. No one and no one in that Hall will ever forget that experience.  Why?

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.490
Why were they trying to get in why the garotte, why the, it sounds like hate is it hate?

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.429
Some of it was hate for sure. Why, why do they hate you?

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.369
Because they because of who they imagine I might be I guess that's part of it

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.710
You know it's it's it's easy to hate someone who's been caricatured and

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.520
So, but there's more to it than that I have been very

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.590
Forceful. Let's say and my criticisms of the radical left not only in Canada

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:46.249
But in the West in general not critical enough in my estimation, so I hold no stock whatsoever for the radical leftist

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.029
I'm absolutely appalled that they're the force they are in the universities

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.730
and I do believe that in many ways the universities have done more harm in society than good over the last 20 years and

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.969
I say that you know with a fair bit of regret because I've been obviously associated with universities since 1993

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:08.029
But that, it's a really interesting thing, I sometimes enjoy dealing with the radical lift in the university so I think you're gonna grow up

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.460
You're going to get through this and I enjoy the the challenge and the drama and the yeah

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.639
It's a challenge of youth saying you're wrong well

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.189
I'm right, and I know I'm right because I'm 20 and I know everything it's not the students so much. I'm concerned about

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.990
Staff is it. Oh, yeah, it's the staff and the administrators, and no it's not the students

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:34.970
I mean look I've been protested against I watched the protesters and most of the time the vast majority of them are young people whose

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.840
Whose?

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.619
Desire to have a positive influence in the world is

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.940
Channeled into this particular political expression at the moment, but so many of them are manipulated by the faculty members hmm

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.969
And there's no excuse for that and what they're doing is is far more dangerous than it looks why do young men?

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.760
need you

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.829
Well first of all you know, it's not I would say it's not just young men part of that's an

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.310
Artifact of the fact that most of the people who watch YouTube are young men?

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.749
but but I won't evade the question I mean because

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.580
See to some degree

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.150
Maturation among men is a voluntary process. It's not so voluntary for women. They have to grow up fast

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:22.220
They have a lot of things to do before they hit 30 yeah with men it can it can take longer

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.910
And they need a call to adventure

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.809
Let's say, and they need a call to responsibility

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.310
And they need to be they need to to be initiated into

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.700
Responsibility and to have a case made for its utility

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.319
And so I'm saying look it's better to be adult than to be a child. It's better

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:41.419
It's better to be in control of your own destiny

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.609
There's a place for you in the world the world would be lesser if you don't take your place in it

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:53.220
That you have a responsibility to bear to sort out your education to straighten out your life and to become who you are

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.020
Grow the hell up don't grow up and and for reasons that are

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.620
Positive for you positive for your family positive for everyone, so is but is this generation lost

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:08.300
They desperate they're clinging to what you're saying and doing in a desperate. I'm not criticizing what you're saying

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.300
I'm doing, but they need it. They need it desperately

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:16.340
why why they think I think that I think that every generation needs a

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.609
Message that that that supports

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.729
maturation and and responsibility

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:30.439
I think that we've done a bad job as a culture of putting that message forward so to me since the mid-1960s

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:38.750
Our young people have been fed a never ending diet of rights and impulsive freedoms something like that and that leaves a hole

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.479
because most of the meaning that people

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.969
people manage in their lives

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:48.919
And so that would be the meaning that you can offset against the tragedy of life that comes from adopting

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:55.309
Responsibility and carrying a load like human beings in some sense our design for a load and the heavier the load the better

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.500
It's it's one of the things that gives you

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:04.760
You know there's this this proclivity among psychologists to attempt to facilitate self-esteem which is a word

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.900
I don't care much for I think that self-respect is a much better term

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:15.049
And I think you develop self-respect by carrying a responsibility I feel very lucky to be born in this country

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:19.160
I think it's essentially a decent country does follow a lot of what happens in the United States

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.269
I'll get to that in a moment, but I was talking to some welfare workers police Salvation

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.190
Army yesterday saying to me

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.510
They think society is becoming and and particularly the younger the age group

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.040
We're talking is becoming more aggressive more cynical more angry

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.799
Do you agree with that and if so why well?

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:44.120
I don't think the statistics bear that out because what we've seen over all over the last especially the last 20 years is a

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.429
remarkable decline in violent crime I

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:54.109
do think that there might be an epidemic more of aimlessness and and and depression and anxiety that sort of thing and

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:59.809
I think that that's partly because the case for growing up is not made well

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:07.100
And and and because we're also so cynical about our own societies. You know I was in Amsterdam month ago talking to a group of

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.900
well-placed intellectuals

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:14.479
They're all friends of Theo van Gogh who was who was killed in in in Amsterdam about 15 years ago was stabbed

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.970
And there they said that embarrassment about the Dutch culture is rampant in their society

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:20.520
and I

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:26.210
That just makes my jaw drop because I go to Holland and I think my god this is such an amazing place these people they

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:33.860
Scrape this country out of the bottom of the ocean they built dikes to hold back the waves. It's it's free. It's it's liberal

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:39.540
It's it's compassionate its orderly. It's beautiful. Yet they're embarrassed by it. They're embarrassed by it because of its

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.120
Tyrannical patriarchal nature, it's like well. Who are you comparing it to it's like?

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:51.260
What are we comparing our societies to where do you want to live it on on the planet or in time anywhere?

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:56.179
But in the West not if you have any sense you think you've sort of been described as a warrior

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.460
Against political correctness is that fit?

00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.940
Yeah

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.640
Tell me about this in our national carrier Qantas. Got some attention early this week and I was thinking about this

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.640
I knew you were coming in and

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.489
Taking advice from a diversity group. That's that's a bad idea

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.979
And I wanted to ban words like guys and chairmen husband and wife

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.710
Replaceable replace words like mankind and chairman. What's your reaction to that?

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.789
I think that it would be better if people tried to solve some real problems

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.439
Instead of playing these idiot diversity games. I think that

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.270
Everyone who plays identity politics whether they play it on the right or the left is

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.719
is going to pay for it in ways they can hardly imagine. It's a very

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.080
Counterproductive way of dividing up the world

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.500
it's an it's

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:51.440
Impossible to come to a peaceful solution in the identity politics universe even the identity politics types themselves they've run into this problem they call

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:57.349
Intersectionality right so ok so you classify people by race and by sex let's say

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:05.810
So and and seek for equity along those dimensions, but then well what about the intersection between those dimensions?

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.810
So you you have enough?

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:17.209
Ethnic minorities in your in your organization, let's say you match by population which is a foolish way of doing it

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.239
But you do that and maybe you're matched by sex

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:27.080
But then what about the intersection between race and sex well then what about the intersection between race sex ethnicity?

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:33.140
Then you could add social class to that then you could add social proclivity then you could add attractiveness

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:40.849
There's never-ending way of dividing people up into groups, and you can't equalize across all those ways. It's just technically not possible

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:45.830
Do you think people need to make a stand on issues like this and when an airline like Qantas makes these?

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.180
decisions do they need to stand against it do they need to boycott it and to do that sort of thing I

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.969
I think they need to understand it at a deeper level

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:55.130
It's like we have to decide if we're going to

00:12:55.350 --> 00:13:00.500
Divide people up if we think that dividing people up primarily by their group identity is a good idea

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.830
And it's not it's a bad idea it will lead to

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.879
an enhancement of our tribal proclivities

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:14.089
and I don't think that if you're a an advocate of peace that you would push and

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.650
advocate for

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:23.119
Ours further division into tribal entities. It's a it's not wise is this transient when we move through this

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:28.910
We'll see it's been not transient in the past. It's caused tremendous troubles in the past

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.680
This is another reason why I'm not a fan of the radical leftists, so

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.290
The the radical left ideologies were were murderous in their expression throughout the 20th century

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:44.680
I mentioned earlier this country follows a lot of the US trends good and bad...Like Canada...We're a little bit behind, but it can be fashioned

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.300
well

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:51.049
What do we need to be alert to what do we need to be aware of what we need to avoid?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.970
We need to

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.459
We need to be alert to the benefits of the societies that we now inhabit

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:06.889
We need to be grateful for their existence and and note very carefully the unlikelihood of their continued success

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.300
No, I don't understand. How we managed it

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:18.769
In the West we have societies where the default assumption between human beings is trust. I do not understand. How we manage that

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.459
because

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:24.529
There's so many ways that you can be betrayed by someone especially if you don't know them

00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:29.208
How do you set up a society where the typical interaction between strangers is straight? Oh?

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:35.390
How many societies in the world are like that like 30 40 something like that how did that ever happen?

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:41.899
We don't know and it's an ongoing miracle, and we should do everything we can not to disrupt it because the alternative to that

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:50.390
Generous trust that courageous trust, which is unbelievably productive is ruled by thug, and that's the rule in most of the world

00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:53.659
So do  you have optimism or not for the future?

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.769
I think we're in a time of extreme chaos

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:03.589
Things could go unbelievably well if we were careful. There's so many good things going on in the world right now

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.760
they're almost miraculous so for example between the year 2000 and

00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:11.659
2012 the level of absolute poverty in the world was cut by 50%

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:15.709
That was the fastest rate of improvement by a large margin in human history

00:15:15.709 --> 00:15:19.489
It was three years faster than the most optimistic projections had suggested

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.240
There's hundreds of thousands of people a week now being being

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:31.339
Pulled into the electrical power grid almost everyone has access to almost infinite computational power and all the educational resources that go along with that

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:36.890
We're wiping out most transmissible diseases the fastest growing economies in the world are in sub-saharan

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.670
Africa like there are a lot of things. There's no starvation in China

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.079
There's a huge middle class in China and India these things are absolutely miraculous

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.240
So and and god only knows what we could accomplish if we got our act together in the next 20 years

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.350
You know the sky's the limit

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:58.909
So, but we're playing very foolish games in the West and we could bring the house down around us, so we'll see

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.940
Thank you so much for coming in good luck with the burden oh

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:09.650
Thanks very much for the invitation and for the interview Jordan B. Peterson 12 rules for life an antidote to chaos
