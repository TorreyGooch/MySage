00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.550 align:start position:0%
for our own words and their and the
ramifications<00:00:19.920><c> so</c><00:00:20.080><c> we</c><00:00:20.160><c> have</c><00:00:20.320><c> to</c><00:00:20.400><c> be</c>

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
ramifications so we have to be
 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.870 align:start position:0%
ramifications so we have to be
controlled<00:00:21.199><c> and</c><00:00:21.359><c> we</c><00:00:21.439><c> have</c><00:00:21.600><c> to</c><00:00:21.680><c> be</c><00:00:22.160><c> stifled</c><00:00:22.720><c> by</c>

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
controlled and we have to be stifled by
 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.029 align:start position:0%
controlled and we have to be stifled by
the<00:00:22.960><c> state</c><00:00:23.199><c> and</c><00:00:23.279><c> it's</c><00:00:23.519><c> very</c><00:00:24.240><c> it</c><00:00:24.320><c> makes</c><00:00:24.560><c> me</c><00:00:24.720><c> very</c>

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
the state and it's very it makes me very
 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.630 align:start position:0%
the state and it's very it makes me very
nervous

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
nervous
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.029 align:start position:0%
nervous
so<00:00:27.119><c> i've</c><00:00:27.359><c> been</c><00:00:27.599><c> thinking</c><00:00:28.000><c> through</c>

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 align:start position:0%
so i've been thinking through
 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.549 align:start position:0%
so i've been thinking through
um<00:00:30.000><c> the</c><00:00:30.400><c> importance</c><00:00:30.960><c> of</c><00:00:31.279><c> free</c><00:00:31.519><c> speech</c><00:00:32.399><c> i</c>

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
um the importance of free speech i
 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.630 align:start position:0%
um the importance of free speech i
suppose<00:00:32.960><c> from</c><00:00:33.200><c> a</c><00:00:33.280><c> psychological</c><00:00:34.000><c> perspective</c>

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
suppose from a psychological perspective
 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.670 align:start position:0%
suppose from a psychological perspective
and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
and
 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.510 align:start position:0%
and
it<00:00:35.840><c> seems</c><00:00:36.160><c> to</c><00:00:36.239><c> me</c><00:00:36.480><c> that</c>

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.510 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
well<00:00:37.920><c> we</c><00:00:38.079><c> can</c><00:00:38.239><c> walk</c><00:00:38.480><c> through</c><00:00:38.640><c> some</c><00:00:38.879><c> axioms</c><00:00:39.440><c> and</c>

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
well we can walk through some axioms and
 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.790 align:start position:0%
well we can walk through some axioms and
you<00:00:39.680><c> can</c><00:00:39.840><c> tell</c><00:00:40.000><c> me</c><00:00:40.079><c> what</c><00:00:40.239><c> you</c><00:00:40.399><c> think</c><00:00:40.559><c> about</c>

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
you can tell me what you think about
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.069 align:start position:0%
you can tell me what you think about
them<00:00:41.040><c> if</c><00:00:41.120><c> you</c><00:00:41.280><c> would</c>

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
them if you would
 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.590 align:start position:0%
them if you would
so

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.670 align:start position:0%
so
i<00:00:43.680><c> mean</c><00:00:43.920><c> the</c><00:00:44.000><c> first</c><00:00:44.239><c> thing</c><00:00:44.480><c> we</c><00:00:44.640><c> might</c><00:00:45.120><c> posit</c><00:00:45.520><c> is</c>

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
i mean the first thing we might posit is
 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.869 align:start position:0%
i mean the first thing we might posit is
that

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 align:start position:0%
that
 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.190 align:start position:0%
that
it's<00:00:47.200><c> useful</c><00:00:47.680><c> to</c><00:00:47.920><c> think</c><00:00:48.480><c> it's</c><00:00:48.719><c> better</c><00:00:49.039><c> to</c>

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's useful to think it's better to
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.950 align:start position:0%
it's useful to think it's better to
think<00:00:49.440><c> than</c><00:00:49.600><c> not</c><00:00:49.840><c> to</c><00:00:50.000><c> think</c><00:00:50.320><c> and</c><00:00:50.559><c> that</c><00:00:50.719><c> might</c>

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
think than not to think and that might
 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.350 align:start position:0%
think than not to think and that might
seem<00:00:51.199><c> self-evident</c><00:00:51.920><c> but</c>

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
seem self-evident but
 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.430 align:start position:0%
seem self-evident but
but<00:00:53.600><c> thought</c><00:00:53.840><c> can</c><00:00:54.000><c> be</c><00:00:54.160><c> troublesome</c><00:00:54.960><c> and</c><00:00:55.120><c> stir</c>

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
but thought can be troublesome and stir
 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.350 align:start position:0%
but thought can be troublesome and stir
up<00:00:55.680><c> trouble</c><00:00:56.000><c> and</c><00:00:56.239><c> your</c><00:00:56.480><c> thoughts</c><00:00:56.719><c> can</c><00:00:56.879><c> be</c>

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
up trouble and your thoughts can be
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.189 align:start position:0%
up trouble and your thoughts can be
inaccurate<00:00:58.079><c> so</c>

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
inaccurate so
 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.310 align:start position:0%
inaccurate so
it's<00:00:59.440><c> perhaps</c><00:00:59.840><c> not</c><00:01:00.079><c> that</c>

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's perhaps not that
 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.750 align:start position:0%
it's perhaps not that
unreasonable<00:01:03.039><c> to</c>

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to
 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.109 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to
start<00:01:04.080><c> the</c><00:01:04.239><c> questioning</c><00:01:04.720><c> there</c><00:01:04.960><c> but</c>

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
start the questioning there but
 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.630 align:start position:0%
start the questioning there but
i<00:01:07.200><c> think</c><00:01:07.360><c> it</c><00:01:07.439><c> was</c><00:01:07.600><c> alfred</c><00:01:08.000><c> north</c><00:01:08.240><c> whitehead</c>

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
i think it was alfred north whitehead
 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.270 align:start position:0%
i think it was alfred north whitehead
who<00:01:08.880><c> said</c><00:01:09.119><c> that</c>

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
who said that
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.710 align:start position:0%
who said that
thinking<00:01:11.760><c> allows</c>

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
thinking allows
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.310 align:start position:0%
thinking allows

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 align:start position:0%

and<00:01:16.720><c> so</c>

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
and so
 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.469 align:start position:0%
and so
he<00:01:18.799><c> was</c><00:01:19.040><c> thinking</c><00:01:19.360><c> about</c><00:01:19.600><c> the</c><00:01:19.840><c> evolution</c><00:01:20.400><c> of</c>

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 align:start position:0%
he was thinking about the evolution of
