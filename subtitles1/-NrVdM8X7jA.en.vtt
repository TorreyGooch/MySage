00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
self-aware and have been for a long time
 

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.230 align:start position:0%
self-aware and have been for a long time

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
and I think that that
 

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.470 align:start position:0%
and I think that that
is<00:09:18.240><c> because</c><00:09:18.519><c> I</c><00:09:18.600><c> had</c><00:09:18.720><c> to</c><00:09:18.760><c> grow</c><00:09:18.920><c> up</c><00:09:19.040><c> very</c><00:09:19.200><c> quickly</c>

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
is because I had to grow up very quickly
 

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.870 align:start position:0%
is because I had to grow up very quickly
in<00:09:19.600><c> terms</c><00:09:19.800><c> of</c><00:09:19.920><c> my</c><00:09:20.040><c> family</c><00:09:20.279><c> I</c><00:09:20.320><c> was</c><00:09:20.480><c> just</c><00:09:20.640><c> very</c>

you also said you didn't want to cause
 

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.430 align:start position:0%
you also said you didn't want to cause

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
unnecessary trouble but I don't think
 

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.710 align:start position:0%
unnecessary trouble but I don't think
that<00:09:30.360><c> means</c><00:09:30.640><c> that</c><00:09:30.800><c> I</c><00:09:30.880><c> was</c><00:09:31.040><c> not</c><00:09:31.200><c> willing</c><00:09:31.519><c> to</c>

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
that means that I was not willing to
 

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.790 align:start position:0%
that means that I was not willing to
stand<00:09:32.000><c> up</c><00:09:32.120><c> for</c><00:09:32.320><c> myself</c><00:09:33.560><c> because</c><00:09:34.560><c> in</c>

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
stand up for myself because in
 

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.630 align:start position:0%
stand up for myself because in

anyway<00:09:41.480><c> I</c><00:09:41.640><c> I</c><00:09:41.720><c> think</c><00:09:41.839><c> that</c><00:09:41.959><c> I</c><00:09:42.040><c> was</c><00:09:42.200><c> very</c>
