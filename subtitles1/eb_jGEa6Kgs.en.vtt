00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
emotion and so the positive emotion
 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.270 align:start position:0%
emotion and so the positive emotion
moves<00:07:57.520><c> you</c><00:07:57.680><c> forward</c><00:07:58.080><c> but</c><00:07:58.280><c> also</c><00:07:59.199><c> in</c><00:07:59.520><c> encourages</c>

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
moves you forward but also in encourages
 

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.149 align:start position:0%
moves you forward but also in encourages
you<00:08:00.479><c> to</c><00:08:00.720><c> develop</c><00:08:01.159><c> a</c><00:08:01.440><c> habit</c><00:08:02.159><c> of</c><00:08:02.400><c> that</c><00:08:02.720><c> practice</c>

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
you to develop a habit of that practice
 

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:05.110 align:start position:0%
