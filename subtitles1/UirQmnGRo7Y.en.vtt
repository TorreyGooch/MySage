figure out why the greens don't get this
 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.950 align:start position:0%
figure out why the greens don't get this
because<00:00:13.120><c> in</c><00:00:13.360><c> principle</c><00:00:13.719><c> they're</c><00:00:13.880><c> on</c><00:00:14.040><c> the</c><00:00:14.280><c> left</c>

comes but like the thing is like I take
Germany<00:00:23.480><c> as</c><00:00:23.680><c> example</c><00:00:24.199><c> like</c><00:00:24.320><c> the</c><00:00:24.480><c> green</c><00:00:24.800><c> lobby</c>

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
Germany as example like the green lobby
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.349 align:start position:0%
Germany as example like the green lobby
got<00:00:25.400><c> into</c><00:00:25.880><c> essentially</c><00:00:26.320><c> a</c><00:00:26.480><c> position</c><00:00:26.800><c> of</c><00:00:27.039><c> power</c>

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
got into essentially a position of power
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.750 align:start position:0%
got into essentially a position of power
within<00:00:27.640><c> that</c><00:00:27.840><c> country</c><00:00:28.400><c> and</c><00:00:28.519><c> they're</c>

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
within that country and they're
 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.509 align:start position:0%
within that country and they're
effectively<00:00:29.199><c> left</c><00:00:29.519><c> with</c>

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 align:start position:0%
effectively left with
 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.830 align:start position:0%
effectively left with
um<00:00:30.759><c> yeah</c><00:00:31.439><c> and</c><00:00:32.439><c> they</c><00:00:32.640><c> were</c><00:00:32.960><c> very</c><00:00:33.320><c> they</c><00:00:33.480><c> heavily</c>

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah and they were very they heavily
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.590 align:start position:0%
um yeah and they were very they heavily
campaigned<00:00:34.320><c> against</c><00:00:34.600><c> nuclear</c><00:00:34.960><c> to</c><00:00:35.160><c> push</c><00:00:35.399><c> for</c>

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
campaigned against nuclear to push for
 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.630 align:start position:0%
campaigned against nuclear to push for
other<00:00:35.879><c> renewable</c><00:00:36.480><c> Solutions</c><00:00:36.960><c> so</c><00:00:37.120><c> they</c><00:00:37.360><c> pushed</c>

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
other renewable Solutions so they pushed
 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.790 align:start position:0%
other renewable Solutions so they pushed
heavily<00:00:37.960><c> into</c><00:00:38.200><c> wind</c><00:00:38.399><c> and</c><00:00:38.600><c> solar</c><00:00:39.480><c> but</c><00:00:39.640><c> the</c>

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
heavily into wind and solar but the
 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.510 align:start position:0%
heavily into wind and solar but the
result<00:00:40.079><c> of</c><00:00:40.280><c> that</c><00:00:40.440><c> was</c><00:00:40.600><c> that</c><00:00:40.760><c> the</c><00:00:40.920><c> country</c><00:00:41.320><c> no</c>

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
result of that was that the country no
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.830 align:start position:0%
result of that was that the country no
longer<00:00:41.800><c> could</c><00:00:42.000><c> power</c><00:00:42.320><c> itself</c><00:00:43.079><c> it</c><00:00:43.239><c> had</c><00:00:43.360><c> to</c><00:00:43.559><c> buy</c>

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 align:start position:0%

is incredibly polluting and and and they
 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.349 align:start position:0%
is incredibly polluting and and and they
also<00:00:58.480><c> had</c><00:00:58.600><c> to</c><00:00:58.760><c> buy</c><00:00:59.719><c> um</c>

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
also had to buy um
 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.869 align:start position:0%
also had to buy um
ironically<00:01:02.359><c> um</c><00:01:02.800><c> energy</c><00:01:03.199><c> from</c><00:01:03.399><c> France</c><00:01:03.760><c> which</c>

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 align:start position:0%
ironically um energy from France which
 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.190 align:start position:0%
ironically um energy from France which
was<00:01:04.159><c> generated</c><00:01:04.600><c> by</c><00:01:04.720><c> nuclear</c><00:01:05.199><c> power</c><00:01:05.479><c> so</c><00:01:05.880><c> right</c>

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
was generated by nuclear power so right
 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.109 align:start position:0%
was generated by nuclear power so right
right<00:01:06.439><c> the</c><00:01:06.880><c> costs</c><00:01:07.880><c> the</c><00:01:08.080><c> costs</c><00:01:08.360><c> of</c><00:01:08.520><c> the</c><00:01:08.640><c> German</c>

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
right the costs the costs of the German
 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.670 align:start position:0%
right the costs the costs of the German
went<00:01:09.400><c> up</c><00:01:09.799><c> for</c><00:01:10.240><c> their</c><00:01:10.520><c> power</c><00:01:11.000><c> and</c><00:01:11.159><c> they</c><00:01:11.320><c> became</c>

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
went up for their power and they became
 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.390 align:start position:0%
went up for their power and they became
their<00:01:11.840><c> carbon</c><00:01:12.119><c> footprint</c><00:01:12.560><c> went</c><00:01:12.720><c> up</c><00:01:13.200><c> right</c>

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
their carbon footprint went up right
 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.910 align:start position:0%
their carbon footprint went up right
right<00:01:13.560><c> so</c><00:01:13.759><c> we</c><00:01:13.920><c> we</c><00:01:14.000><c> want</c><00:01:14.119><c> to</c><00:01:14.320><c> we</c><00:01:14.400><c> want</c><00:01:14.520><c> to</c><00:01:14.640><c> dwell</c>

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
right so we we want to we want to dwell
 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.710 align:start position:0%
right so we we want to we want to dwell
on<00:01:15.080><c> that</c><00:01:15.240><c> for</c><00:01:15.360><c> a</c><00:01:15.439><c> minute</c><00:01:15.680><c> so</c><00:01:15.840><c> the</c><00:01:16.119><c> consequence</c>

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
on that for a minute so the consequence
 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.789 align:start position:0%
on that for a minute so the consequence
of<00:01:16.920><c> the</c><00:01:17.080><c> green</c><00:01:17.960><c> movement</c><00:01:18.479><c> in</c><00:01:18.680><c> Germany</c><00:01:19.600><c> was</c>

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
that power let's let's lay it out power
 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.350 align:start position:0%
that power let's let's lay it out power
was<00:01:21.799><c> five</c><00:01:22.079><c> times</c><00:01:22.320><c> more</c><00:01:22.560><c> expensive</c><00:01:23.119><c> than</c><00:01:23.240><c> it</c>

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
was five times more expensive than it
 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.230 align:start position:0%
was five times more expensive than it
should<00:01:23.520><c> have</c><00:01:23.680><c> been</c><00:01:24.320><c> the</c><00:01:24.479><c> Germans</c><00:01:24.920><c> became</c>

let's<00:04:30.360><c> say</c><00:04:30.600><c> but</c><00:04:30.800><c> now</c><00:04:30.960><c> you've</c><00:04:31.199><c> realized</c><00:04:31.600><c> that</c>

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
let's say but now you've realized that
 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.029 align:start position:0%
let's say but now you've realized that
that's<00:04:32.000><c> also</c><00:04:32.240><c> another</c><00:04:32.560><c> Economic</c><00:04:33.080><c> Opportunity</c>

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
that's also another Economic Opportunity
 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.550 align:start position:0%
that's also another Economic Opportunity
so<00:04:34.199><c> it</c><00:04:34.320><c> sounds</c><00:04:34.600><c> to</c><00:04:34.720><c> me</c><00:04:34.919><c> like</c><00:04:35.039><c> you</c><00:04:35.240><c> guys</c><00:04:35.360><c> are</c>

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
so it sounds to me like you guys are
 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.150 align:start position:0%
so it sounds to me like you guys are
planning<00:04:35.880><c> to</c><00:04:36.039><c> build</c><00:04:36.360><c> a</c><00:04:37.160><c> what</c><00:04:37.280><c> would</c><00:04:37.440><c> you</c><00:04:37.560><c> say</c>

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
planning to build a what would you say
 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.070 align:start position:0%
planning to build a what would you say
from<00:04:38.360><c> the</c><00:04:38.520><c> ground</c><00:04:39.160><c> up</c><00:04:40.160><c> Enterprise</c><00:04:40.759><c> that</c><00:04:40.880><c> will</c>

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
from the ground up Enterprise that will
 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.870 align:start position:0%
from the ground up Enterprise that will
allow<00:04:41.400><c> for</c><00:04:41.639><c> these</c><00:04:42.000><c> micro</c><00:04:42.320><c> reactors</c><00:04:42.800><c> to</c><00:04:43.080><c> exist</c>

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
allow for these micro reactors to exist
 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.710 align:start position:0%
allow for these micro reactors to exist
so<00:04:44.120><c> then</c><00:04:44.360><c> I</c><00:04:44.520><c> I</c><00:04:44.600><c> want</c><00:04:44.720><c> to</c><00:04:44.880><c> know</c><00:04:45.520><c> where</c><00:04:45.800><c> you</c><00:04:45.919><c> are</c>
