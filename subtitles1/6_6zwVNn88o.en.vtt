00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.520
Hi, everyone.  As some of

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.810
you may know, but others

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.670
will not, it's been a

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.260
long while since I put up

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.910
any new content on this

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.070
YouTube channel. I've

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.240
been suffering from

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.210
impaired health, severely

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.920
impaired health, as a

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.090
consequence of

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.570
benzodiazepine use for

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.190
anxiety, or more

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.090
accurately, from a

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.460
combination of using that

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.470
medication, and then

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.270
ceasing its use once I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.020
realized it was

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.790
dangerous. That's put me

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.200
in and out of hospitals

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.480
for much of the last

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.720
year, in Connecticut in

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.950
the United States, in

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.290
Toronto in Canada, in

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.530
Moscow in Russia, and in

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.940
Belgrade, Serbia; as my

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.860
family searched for

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.210
specialists who could aid

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.670
me in the severe post-use

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.530
withdrawal and

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.570
neurological damage

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.550
related consequences of

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.680
both the benzodiazepine

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.880
use and its cessation. I

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.660
started taking it in 2016

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.870
early 2017, according to

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.830
the prescribed

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.180
recommendations, and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.200
really never gave it a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.510
second thought. That was

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.790
a mistake, to say the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.100
least. Anyways, I've

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.780
learned some things

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.950
during that trying time,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.010
I suppose, or at least I

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.840
can tell you what kept me

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.250
going during, what was

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.930
certainly the worst

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.070
period of my life:

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.030
family- that's for sure,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.330
friends, and the work I

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.260
was able to continue

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.520
doing, as I was able to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.510
continue writing

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.720
something that I'll talk

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.030
about, probably within

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.010
the next month. My

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.350
family, my wife, Tammy,

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.140
my son Julian and his

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.010
wife Jillian, and my

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.600
daughter Mikhaila and her

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.400
husband Andrey, have been

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.990
of inestimable value to

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.490
me and provided me with

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.690
tremendous support during

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.060
this period. Mikhaila and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.940
Andrey accompanied me to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.440
Russia and to Serbia.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.810
Both of those episodes

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.980
were extremely grueling

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.540
and lasted for months.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.120
But I'm alive, and I have

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.950
plans for the future. I

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.760
want to thank those

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.900
people from the bottom of

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.970
my heart. My extended

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.650
family and friends, whom

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.030
I will name elsewhere,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.830
went above and beyond the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.850
call of duty in my

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.560
estimation. I certainly

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.970
not convinced that I

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.900
would have the character

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.000
to provide to anyone of

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.050
them what they provided

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.060
to me. That was a

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.620
humbling lesson, I

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.900
suppose. My work, this

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.070
sort of work, although it

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.060
was all writing and not

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.020
video production, was

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.150
also extremely useful

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.130
because I could sustain

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.250
myself by producing and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.420
then culling through

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.740
thoughts that were

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.510
helpful, despite my

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.580
anguish, I suppose, and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.560
my lack of hope for the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.240
future. Hopefully, we'll

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.240
see, but hopefully, much

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.380
of that is behind me and

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.050
I can return to something

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.550
resembling a normal life.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.770
I can tell you what my

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.290
plans are for video

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.370
production, at least for

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.770
the next while. I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.960
completed the biblical

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.080
series devoted to Genesis

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.150
in the fall of 2017, and

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.740
that has proved very

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.590
popular. It's a strange

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.580
word to use for a lecture

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.310
series like that. I'm

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.080
going to start working on

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.510
the next book, and the

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.410
Old Testament, which is

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.570
Exodus, that will take a

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.170
while, but in the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.640
interim, I think I'm

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.230
going to produce videos

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.240
devoted to Proverbs, the

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.960
Book of Wisdom

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.430
essentially, or a Book of

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.520
Wisdom. You've all heard,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.780
no doubt, that wisdom is

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.130
proverbial or that

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.030
there's such a thing as

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.200
proverbial wisdom and

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.930
that phrase stems from

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.580
the book of Proverbs,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.490
which are single sentence

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.880
aphorisms imparting some

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.710
truth. I think the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.080
analysis of those, which

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.100
can be done in a

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.180
relatively short period

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.010
of time, will prove of

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.810
benefit to me and perhaps

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.310
to those who are inclined

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.860
to watch or listen to my

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.700
analysis.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.660
I would also like to

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.170
thank all of you for

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.830
continuing to support my

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.200
work. I have far more

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.820
followers on YouTube and

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.130
Instagram, and Twitter,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.320
for that matter, than I

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.870
did before I became ill.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.240
My book has sold very

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.860
well in multiple

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.760
languages, and that's

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.230
really amazing and

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.490
remarkable, and I hope

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.010
that what I produce in

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.020
the future, that people

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.830
will find it of equal or

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.590
greater utility. That's

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.760
an ambitious hope, given

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.410
how much attention, what

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.670
I've produced before, has

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.330
garnered, but it still

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.000
seems an appropriate goal

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.680
for my upcoming

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.440
activities. I guess I

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.240
could let you all know as

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.200
well, that we've put

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.310
together, this is an

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.180
initiative that was

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.400
spearheaded by Mikhaila

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.160
and Andrey, we've put

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.200
together the ability to

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.640
translate the YouTube

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.320
lectures into a variety

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.370
of languages. I think

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.780
it's six at the moment,

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.800
six will be rolled out

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.970
over the next few months,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.990
professionally-translated

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.470
dubbed because our

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.880
analysis indicated that

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.110
in most of these markets,

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.430
dubbed videos are

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.540
preferred to subtitle

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.110
videos. That will provide

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.900
the opportunity for the

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.070
ideas I've been

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.250
developing, many of which

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.230
I have derived from other

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.950
sources, to be sure, to

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.640
have an impact beyond the

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.810
English language-speaking

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.690
world. There seems to be

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.970
some desire for that. My

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.860
last book, "12 Rules for

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.980
Life" sold 300,000 copies

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.420
in South Korea, for

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.740
example, which very much

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.730
surprised me because I

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.830
wasn't sure that the

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.210
ideas, first, were

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.680
translatable, but were

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.110
going to be acceptable in

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.000
a culture with such a

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.170
different developmental

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.420
background. Anyways, I'm

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.350
not going to make this a

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.690
long video, I wanted to

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.950
tell you that I'm back in

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.720
Toronto, that I'm in much

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.710
better health, although

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.970
it's still severely

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.020
impaired, especially in

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.510
the morning. But I can

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.920
work again and I really

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.210
want to and to let you

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.010
know that with God's

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.060
grace, and mercy, I'll be

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.720
able to start generating

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.340
original material once

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.100
again and pick up where I

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.770
left off. Thank you very

00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:00.320
much. Thank you very much

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.580
is probably sufficient.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.380
Bye-bye.
