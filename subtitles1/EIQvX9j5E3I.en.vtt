get back up and do something else
tomorrow<01:17:41.960><c> and</c><01:17:42.120><c> so</c><01:17:42.880><c> whenever</c><01:17:43.239><c> we</c><01:17:43.440><c> came</c>

01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%

because<01:17:47.440><c> we</c><01:17:47.600><c> kind</c><01:17:47.760><c> of</c><01:17:48.080><c> brought</c><01:17:48.480><c> those</c><01:17:48.719><c> two</c>

01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:48.920 align:start position:0%

01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
worlds together well I'd say the
 

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.550 align:start position:0%
worlds together well I'd say the

01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
know had happened and so that's been
 

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:04.270 align:start position:0%
know had happened and so that's been
real<01:47:02.360><c> neat</c><01:47:02.679><c> to</c><01:47:03.199><c> to</c><01:47:03.320><c> be</c><01:47:03.480><c> able</c><01:47:03.639><c> to</c><01:47:03.800><c> put</c><01:47:03.960><c> that</c>

01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
real neat to to be able to put that
 

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:05.910 align:start position:0%
real neat to to be able to put that
together<01:47:04.560><c> and</c><01:47:04.679><c> it's</c><01:47:04.880><c> interesting</c><01:47:05.639><c> like</c><01:47:05.800><c> we</c>

01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
together and it's interesting like we
 

01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:09.109 align:start position:0%
together and it's interesting like we
talk<01:47:06.119><c> about</c><01:47:06.360><c> a</c><01:47:06.480><c> Christian</c><01:47:06.880><c> movie</c><01:47:07.280><c> but</c><01:47:08.119><c> 95%</c><01:47:09.000><c> of</c>

01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
talk about a Christian movie but 95% of
 

01:47:09.119 --> 01:47:11.310 align:start position:0%
talk about a Christian movie but 95% of
this<01:47:09.280><c> movie</c><01:47:09.560><c> is</c><01:47:09.719><c> not</c><01:47:09.960><c> Christian</c>

01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
this movie is not Christian
 

01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:13.589 align:start position:0%
this movie is not Christian
because<01:47:12.320><c> none</c><01:47:12.520><c> of</c><01:47:12.639><c> them</c><01:47:12.760><c> were</c><01:47:13.000><c> Christians</c><01:47:13.480><c> and</c>

01:47:13.589 --> 01:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
because none of them were Christians and
 

01:47:13.599 --> 01:47:15.229 align:start position:0%
because none of them were Christians and
so<01:47:13.760><c> it</c><01:47:13.840><c> wasn't</c><01:47:14.119><c> to</c><01:47:14.320><c> the</c><01:47:14.440><c> end</c><01:47:14.800><c> where</c><01:47:15.040><c> they</c>

01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't to the end where they
 

01:47:15.239 --> 01:47:17.669 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't to the end where they
actually<01:47:15.880><c> embraced</c><01:47:16.520><c> this</c><01:47:16.800><c> Faith</c><01:47:17.080><c> or</c><01:47:17.280><c> whatever</c>

01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
actually embraced this Faith or whatever
 

01:47:17.679 --> 01:47:20.030 align:start position:0%
actually embraced this Faith or whatever
and<01:47:17.800><c> so</c><01:47:17.960><c> it's</c><01:47:18.119><c> just</c><01:47:18.239><c> a</c><01:47:18.400><c> real</c><01:47:18.800><c> story</c><01:47:19.159><c> of</c><01:47:19.480><c> like</c>

01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
and so it's just a real story of like
 

01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:21.270 align:start position:0%
and so it's just a real story of like
how

01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
how
 

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:24.070 align:start position:0%

01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
Hope and promise and um you know but
 

01:47:31.119 --> 01:47:33.750 align:start position:0%
Hope and promise and um you know but
then<01:47:31.280><c> he</c><01:47:31.599><c> just</c><01:47:32.040><c> you</c><01:47:32.199><c> know</c><01:47:32.480><c> went</c><01:47:33.199><c> terribly</c>

01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
then he just you know went terribly
 

01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:36.109 align:start position:0%
then he just you know went terribly
South<01:47:34.239><c> and</c><01:47:34.400><c> then</c><01:47:34.840><c> um</c><01:47:35.080><c> you</c><01:47:35.199><c> know</c><01:47:35.320><c> when</c><01:47:35.599><c> all</c><01:47:35.800><c> hope</c>

01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
South and then um you know when all hope
 

01:47:36.119 --> 01:47:39.310 align:start position:0%
South and then um you know when all hope
seemed<01:47:36.480><c> lost</c><01:47:37.080><c> uh</c><01:47:37.719><c> uh</c><01:47:38.159><c> that's</c><01:47:38.360><c> when</c><01:47:38.639><c> the</c><01:47:39.119><c> the</c>

01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
seemed lost uh uh that's when the the
 

01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:41.109 align:start position:0%
seemed lost uh uh that's when the the
gospel<01:47:39.760><c> came</c><01:47:39.960><c> in</c><01:47:40.239><c> there</c><01:47:40.480><c> and</c><01:47:40.599><c> so</c><01:47:40.800><c> it</c><01:47:40.920><c> pretty</c>

01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
gospel came in there and so it pretty
 

01:47:41.119 --> 01:47:42.910 align:start position:0%
gospel came in there and so it pretty
much<01:47:41.280><c> ends</c><01:47:41.719><c> right</c><01:47:41.880><c> when</c><01:47:42.159><c> Dad</c><01:47:42.440><c> becomes</c><01:47:42.719><c> a</c>

01:47:42.910 --> 01:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
much ends right when Dad becomes a
 

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:45.510 align:start position:0%
much ends right when Dad becomes a
Believer<01:47:43.639><c> he</c><01:47:43.760><c> gets</c><01:47:44.000><c> the</c><01:47:44.159><c> idea</c><01:47:44.639><c> like</c><01:47:44.920><c> okay</c><01:47:45.159><c> now</c>

01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
Believer he gets the idea like okay now
 

01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:47.750 align:start position:0%
Believer he gets the idea like okay now
once<01:47:45.679><c> he's</c><01:47:45.840><c> sobered</c><01:47:46.280><c> up</c><01:47:46.560><c> I</c><01:47:46.639><c> can</c><01:47:47.239><c> maybe</c><01:47:47.480><c> build</c>

01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
once he's sobered up I can maybe build
 

01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.669 align:start position:0%
once he's sobered up I can maybe build
duck<01:47:48.040><c> calls</c><01:47:48.400><c> and</c><01:47:48.560><c> then</c><01:47:48.679><c> it</c><01:47:48.840><c> just</c><01:47:49.199><c> you</c><01:47:49.320><c> know</c>
