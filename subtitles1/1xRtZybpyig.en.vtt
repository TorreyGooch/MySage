in<00:22:14.559><c> some</c><00:22:14.799><c> sense</c><00:22:15.440><c> the</c><00:22:15.600><c> idea</c><00:22:15.840><c> of</c><00:22:16.080><c> satan</c><00:22:16.559><c> is</c>

00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
he's<00:22:19.120><c> the</c><00:22:19.360><c> ultimate</c><00:22:20.080><c> in</c><00:22:20.320><c> serpents</c>

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
he's the ultimate in serpents
 

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.149 align:start position:0%
he's the ultimate in serpents
and<00:22:22.000><c> so</c><00:22:22.159><c> that's</c><00:22:22.480><c> why</c><00:22:22.720><c> that</c><00:22:23.200><c> equation</c><00:22:23.679><c> is</c><00:22:23.760><c> drawn</c>

00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
and so that's why that equation is drawn
 

00:22:24.159 --> 00:22:25.909 align:start position:0%
and so that's why that equation is drawn
across<00:22:24.559><c> time</c><00:22:24.880><c> it's</c><00:22:25.039><c> like</c><00:22:25.440><c> well</c><00:22:25.600><c> what</c>

00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
across time it's like well what
 

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:28.230 align:start position:0%
across time it's like well what

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
threatens you well snakes yeah they're
 

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.549 align:start position:0%
threatens you well snakes yeah they're
pretty<00:22:28.480><c> nasty</c><00:22:29.039><c> well</c>

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
pretty nasty well
 

00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:33.430 align:start position:0%
pretty nasty well
there's<00:22:30.960><c> snakes</c><00:22:31.360><c> and</c><00:22:31.440><c> then</c><00:22:31.600><c> there's</c><00:22:32.000><c> well</c>

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
there's snakes and then there's well
 

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.470 align:start position:0%
there's snakes and then there's well
the<00:22:33.840><c> origin</c><00:22:34.799><c> of</c><00:22:34.960><c> snakes</c><00:22:35.440><c> so</c><00:22:35.600><c> maybe</c><00:22:36.320><c> you</c>

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
the origin of snakes so maybe you
 

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.149 align:start position:0%
the origin of snakes so maybe you
conquer<00:22:36.880><c> a</c><00:22:36.960><c> snake</c><00:22:37.280><c> and</c><00:22:37.360><c> that's</c><00:22:37.600><c> one</c><00:22:37.840><c> thing</c><00:22:38.080><c> and</c>

00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
conquer a snake and that's one thing and
 

00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:39.590 align:start position:0%
conquer a snake and that's one thing and
maybe<00:22:38.480><c> the</c><00:22:38.559><c> next</c><00:22:38.799><c> thing</c><00:22:39.039><c> is</c><00:22:39.120><c> you</c><00:22:39.280><c> go</c><00:22:39.360><c> out</c><00:22:39.520><c> and</c>

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
maybe the next thing is you go out and
 

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.350 align:start position:0%
maybe the next thing is you go out and
you<00:22:39.760><c> find</c><00:22:40.000><c> nests</c><00:22:40.400><c> of</c><00:22:40.480><c> snakes</c><00:22:40.880><c> and</c><00:22:40.960><c> you</c><00:22:41.120><c> root</c>

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
you find nests of snakes and you root
 

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.430 align:start position:0%
you find nests of snakes and you root
them<00:22:41.600><c> out</c><00:22:42.240><c> but</c><00:22:42.400><c> then</c><00:22:42.640><c> there's</c><00:22:42.880><c> the</c><00:22:43.039><c> snakes</c>

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.149 align:start position:0%
them out but then there's the snakes
that<00:22:43.600><c> are</c><00:22:43.679><c> in</c><00:22:43.840><c> the</c><00:22:43.919><c> hearts</c><00:22:44.240><c> of</c><00:22:44.320><c> your</c><00:22:44.559><c> enemies</c>

00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
that's a harder snake to deal with and
 

00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:49.590 align:start position:0%
that's a harder snake to deal with and
then<00:22:48.320><c> there's</c><00:22:48.559><c> the</c><00:22:48.640><c> snake</c><00:22:48.960><c> that's</c><00:22:49.200><c> in</c><00:22:49.360><c> your</c>

then there's the snake that's in your

then there's the snake that's in your

equation between the serpent and satan
 

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:56.870 align:start position:0%

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
comes because the worst of all snakes is
 

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.950 align:start position:0%
comes because the worst of all snakes is
the<00:22:56.960><c> serpent</c><00:22:57.360><c> in</c><00:22:57.520><c> your</c><00:22:57.679><c> own</c><00:22:57.840><c> heart</c>

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
the serpent in your own heart
 

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.669 align:start position:0%
the serpent in your own heart
and<00:22:59.120><c> so</c><00:22:59.520><c> there's</c><00:22:59.760><c> a</c><00:23:00.240><c> there's</c><00:23:00.480><c> a</c>

and so there's a there's a
 

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:02.549 align:start position:0%
and so there's a there's a

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's the worst predator
 

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.070 align:start position:0%
that's the worst predator
okay<00:23:18.159><c> so</c><00:23:18.320><c> there's</c><00:23:18.559><c> the</c><00:23:18.720><c> idea</c><00:23:19.039><c> of</c><00:23:19.120><c> the</c><00:23:19.840><c> the</c>

then<00:41:11.040><c> you</c><00:41:11.200><c> ask</c><00:41:11.440><c> yourself</c><00:41:11.760><c> well</c><00:41:11.920><c> what's</c><00:41:12.160><c> the</c>

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
then you ask yourself well what's the
