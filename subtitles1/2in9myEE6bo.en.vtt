00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
sharp and you think a wife shouldn't be
 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.749 align:start position:0%
sharp and you think a wife shouldn't be
sharp<00:00:05.080><c> to</c><00:00:05.240><c> her</c><00:00:05.400><c> husband</c><00:00:05.960><c> you</c><00:00:06.080><c> can</c><00:00:06.240><c> reverse</c>

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:06.759 align:start position:0%
sharp to her husband you can reverse
 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.270 align:start position:0%
sharp to her husband you can reverse
that<00:00:06.919><c> so</c><00:00:07.160><c> the</c><00:00:07.279><c> husband</c><00:00:07.600><c> shouldn't</c><00:00:07.839><c> be</c><00:00:08.000><c> sharp</c>

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
that so the husband shouldn't be sharp
 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.430 align:start position:0%
that so the husband shouldn't be sharp

to the wife well should I say anything
and<00:00:10.559><c> the</c><00:00:10.719><c> answer</c><00:00:11.000><c> is</c><00:00:11.360><c> probably</c><00:00:11.920><c> no</c><00:00:12.240><c> you</c><00:00:12.320><c> should</c>

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
and the answer is probably no you should
 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.470 align:start position:0%
and the answer is probably no you should
just<00:00:12.679><c> let</c><00:00:12.799><c> it</c><00:00:13.040><c> go</c><00:00:13.280><c> you</c><00:00:13.360><c> shouldn't</c><00:00:13.799><c> regard</c><00:00:14.240><c> that</c>

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
just let it go you shouldn't regard that
 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.550 align:start position:0%
just let it go you shouldn't regard that
error<00:00:15.080><c> as</c><00:00:15.879><c> indicative</c><00:00:16.480><c> of</c><00:00:16.600><c> a</c><00:00:16.840><c> sufficient</c>

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
error as indicative of a sufficient
 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.150 align:start position:0%

the<00:00:21.600><c> day</c><00:00:22.600><c> you</c><00:00:22.760><c> see</c><00:00:23.199><c> your</c><00:00:23.400><c> wife</c><00:00:23.640><c> again</c><00:00:23.840><c> the</c><00:00:24.000><c> same</c>

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
the day you see your wife again the same
 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.950 align:start position:0%
the day you see your wife again the same
thing<00:00:24.480><c> happens</c><00:00:24.800><c> and</c><00:00:24.960><c> you</c><00:00:25.080><c> think</c><00:00:25.439><c> okay</c><00:00:25.720><c> that's</c>

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
thing happens and you think okay that's
 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.990 align:start position:0%
thing happens and you think okay that's
twice<00:00:26.679><c> but</c><00:00:26.800><c> you</c><00:00:26.960><c> still</c><00:00:27.199><c> don't</c><00:00:27.400><c> say</c><00:00:27.640><c> anything</c>

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
twice but you still don't say anything
 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.070 align:start position:0%
twice but you still don't say anything
because<00:00:28.160><c> you</c><00:00:28.279><c> think</c><00:00:28.519><c> well</c><00:00:28.640><c> maybe</c><00:00:28.840><c> she's</c>

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
because you think well maybe she's
 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.230 align:start position:0%
because you think well maybe she's
hungry<00:00:29.400><c> or</c><00:00:29.519><c> maybe</c><00:00:29.720><c> she's</c><00:00:30.080><c> tired</c><00:00:30.359><c> or</c><00:00:30.880><c> we</c><00:00:31.000><c> don't</c>

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
hungry or maybe she's tired or we don't
 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.870 align:start position:0%
hungry or maybe she's tired or we don't
really<00:00:31.480><c> need</c><00:00:31.640><c> to</c><00:00:31.800><c> have</c><00:00:31.880><c> a</c><00:00:32.040><c> fight</c><00:00:32.320><c> about</c><00:00:32.599><c> this</c>

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
really need to have a fight about this
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.470 align:start position:0%
really need to have a fight about this
because<00:00:33.160><c> that</c><00:00:33.280><c> would</c><00:00:33.440><c> be</c><00:00:33.600><c> its</c><00:00:33.760><c> own</c><00:00:34.120><c> problem</c>

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
because that would be its own problem
 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.350 align:start position:0%
because that would be its own problem
and<00:00:35.079><c> we'll</c><00:00:35.360><c> just</c><00:00:35.640><c> assume</c><00:00:36.360><c> it's</c><00:00:36.559><c> only</c><00:00:36.879><c> twice</c>

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
and we'll just assume it's only twice
 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.069 align:start position:0%
and we'll just assume it's only twice
then<00:00:37.480><c> it</c><00:00:37.600><c> happens</c><00:00:37.960><c> three</c><00:00:38.200><c> times</c><00:00:38.440><c> you</c><00:00:38.600><c> think</c>

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
then it happens three times you think
 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.389 align:start position:0%
then it happens three times you think
okay<00:00:39.520><c> three</c><00:00:39.960><c> establishes</c><00:00:40.640><c> the</c><00:00:40.800><c> pattern</c><00:00:41.280><c> then</c>

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
okay three establishes the pattern then
 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.630 align:start position:0%
okay three establishes the pattern then
you<00:00:41.480><c> say</c><00:00:41.800><c> hey</c><00:00:42.600><c> I</c><00:00:42.680><c> need</c><00:00:42.840><c> to</c><00:00:43.000><c> talk</c><00:00:43.160><c> to</c><00:00:43.280><c> you</c><00:00:43.399><c> for</c><00:00:43.520><c> a</c>

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 align:start position:0%
you say hey I need to talk to you for a
 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.750 align:start position:0%
you say hey I need to talk to you for a
minute<00:00:43.960><c> I</c><00:00:44.079><c> came</c><00:00:44.239><c> in</c><00:00:44.440><c> here</c><00:00:44.719><c> this</c><00:00:44.879><c> morning</c><00:00:45.320><c> and</c>

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
minute I came in here this morning and
 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.950 align:start position:0%
minute I came in here this morning and
this<00:00:45.960><c> is</c><00:00:46.120><c> what</c><00:00:46.320><c> happened</c><00:00:46.920><c> what's</c><00:00:47.280><c> going</c><00:00:47.520><c> on</c>

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
this is what happened what's going on
 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.590 align:start position:0%
this is what happened what's going on
wouldn't<00:00:48.199><c> it</c><00:00:48.280><c> be</c><00:00:48.399><c> easier</c><00:00:48.760><c> just</c><00:00:48.879><c> to</c><00:00:49.079><c> ignore</c><00:00:49.399><c> it</c>

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be easier just to ignore it
 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.229 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be easier just to ignore it
and<00:00:49.719><c> the</c><00:00:49.879><c> answer</c><00:00:50.160><c> is</c><00:00:50.760><c> yeah</c><00:00:51.760><c> in</c><00:00:51.879><c> the</c><00:00:52.039><c> short</c><00:00:52.359><c> term</c>

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
and the answer is yeah in the short term
 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.790 align:start position:0%
and the answer is yeah in the short term
but<00:00:53.480><c> if</c><00:00:53.640><c> you</c><00:00:54.160><c> ignore</c><00:00:55.160><c> a</c><00:00:55.359><c> thousand</c><00:00:55.760><c> of</c><00:00:56.000><c> those</c>

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
but if you ignore a thousand of those
 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
but if you ignore a thousand of those
events<00:00:57.440><c> then</c><00:00:57.600><c> your</c><00:00:57.760><c> marriage</c><00:00:58.120><c> will</c><00:00:58.280><c> be</c><00:00:58.440><c> over</c>
