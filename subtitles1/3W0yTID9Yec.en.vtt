00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
lot of
 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.069 align:start position:0%
lot of
ways<00:01:32.600><c> and</c><00:01:33.240><c> so</c><00:01:34.240><c> uh</c><00:01:34.399><c> and</c><00:01:34.520><c> we</c><00:01:34.640><c> also</c><00:01:34.799><c> didn't</c><00:01:35.000><c> want</c>

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
ways and so uh and we also didn't want
 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.950 align:start position:0%
ways and so uh and we also didn't want
to<00:01:35.240><c> repeat</c><00:01:35.720><c> just</c><00:01:36.119><c> uh</c><00:01:36.399><c> the</c><00:01:36.560><c> you</c><00:01:36.600><c> know</c><00:01:36.720><c> we</c><00:01:36.799><c> didn't</c>

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
to repeat just uh the you know we didn't
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.350 align:start position:0%
to repeat just uh the you know we didn't
want<00:01:37.040><c> to</c><00:01:37.119><c> do</c><00:01:37.320><c> what</c><00:01:37.439><c> is</c><00:01:37.520><c> a</c><00:01:37.640><c> woman</c><00:01:37.920><c> but</c><00:01:38.119><c> with</c><00:01:38.360><c> race</c>

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
want to do what is a woman but with race
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.590 align:start position:0%
want to do what is a woman but with race
so<00:01:39.560><c> at</c><00:01:39.680><c> this</c><00:01:39.799><c> time</c><00:01:39.960><c> we</c><00:01:40.079><c> thought</c><00:01:40.280><c> it'd</c><00:01:40.479><c> be</c>

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
so at this time we thought it'd be
 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.350 align:start position:0%
so at this time we thought it'd be
interesting<00:01:40.960><c> to</c><00:01:41.119><c> take</c><00:01:41.600><c> a</c><00:01:41.720><c> different</c><00:01:41.960><c> approach</c>

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
interesting to take a different approach
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.870 align:start position:0%
interesting to take a different approach
and<00:01:42.520><c> and</c><00:01:42.640><c> that</c><00:01:42.759><c> is</c><00:01:42.920><c> to</c>

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
and and that is to
 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.830 align:start position:0%
and and that is to
start<00:01:44.880><c> uh</c><00:01:45.119><c> as</c><00:01:45.360><c> the</c><00:01:45.600><c> cluess</c><00:01:46.240><c> naive</c>

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
start uh as the cluess naive
 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.510 align:start position:0%
start uh as the cluess naive

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.550 align:start position:0%

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
questions the only difference here is

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
us and we really did approach it in in
 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.030 align:start position:0%
us and we really did approach it in in
filming<00:02:28.680><c> this</c><00:02:28.840><c> way</c><00:02:29.120><c> so</c><00:02:29.280><c> that</c><00:02:29.400><c> we</c><00:02:29.480><c> had</c><00:02:29.560><c> a</c><00:02:29.640><c> really</c>

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
script it out because we go to talk to
 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.150 align:start position:0%
script it out because we go to talk to
someone<00:02:37.319><c> we</c><00:02:37.440><c> don't</c><00:02:37.560><c> know</c><00:02:37.680><c> exactly</c><00:02:38.040><c> what</c>

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
someone we don't know exactly what
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.190 align:start position:0%
someone we don't know exactly what
they're<00:02:38.280><c> going</c><00:02:38.400><c> to</c><00:02:38.480><c> say</c><00:02:38.680><c> or</c><00:02:38.840><c> how</c><00:02:38.959><c> it's</c><00:02:39.080><c> going</c>

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to say or how it's going
 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.149 align:start position:0%
they're going to say or how it's going

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
to go and so this is why filming it was
 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.309 align:start position:0%
to go and so this is why filming it was
over<00:02:43.400><c> a</c><00:02:43.519><c> year</c><00:02:43.720><c> was</c><00:02:43.840><c> a</c><00:02:43.959><c> long</c><00:02:44.280><c> process</c><00:02:45.159><c> because</c>
