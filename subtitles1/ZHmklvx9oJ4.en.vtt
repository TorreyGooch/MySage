00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.540
So momentarily we’re going to return to
the basic story.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.550
I want to talk to you today about how your
brain organizes your perceptions, and then

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.760
I want to talk to you about how that’s represented
in mythology.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:31.720
The first thing I’d like to point out, is
we talked about the difference between Darwinian

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:40.879
and Newtonian viewpoints a while back.

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.299
One claim that you might make if you were
Darwinian is that whatever your brain is adapted

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:49.120
to is reality.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.720
That seems to be the central claim of Darwinian
evolution, is that you can’t define reality

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.379
any more accurately than that which selects.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.820
I want to tell you about how I think the brain
is organized.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.650
Then I want to show you, I hope, that the
way fundamental narratives work can be mapped

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.340
on to that brain structure.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.620
To me that implies that there’s something
right about fundamental narratives, because

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.160
otherwise why would they map onto the brain
structures that have evolved to adapt us to

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.960
the environment?

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.490
People think about reality in objective terms,
and they think about it as decomposable into

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.310
tiny subunits.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.000
I think that’s a limited viewpoint, a powerful
but limited viewpoint.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.229
I think it’s much more realistic to assume
that whatever reality is, is more like a continual

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.190
interplay of very, very complex patterns.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.890
I suppose you could make the case that those
patterns are ultimately made out of particles,

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.840
but even that’s not exactly true because
the particles have to be arrayed in space.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.390
That’s part of the atomic theory is that
there’s not just subatomic particles and

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.030
atomic particles, but that they’re arrayed
in space.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.100
If they’re arrayed in space, that means
the manner in which they’re arrayed can

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.100
be informative.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.480
And if you reduce the phenoma to the particle,
without taking into account the patterning

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.900
of array of the particles, then there are
levels and levels and levels of information

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.130
that you lose.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.840
Those levels of information are – they may
not be relevant for our physical understanding

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.490
of the make-up of atomic and subatomic particles,
but they’re definitely relevant to whether

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.350
we can walk across the street safely.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:08.020
I would say if you’re related to reality
properly, the kind of information that you’re

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.580
processing is precisely the kind of information
that allows you to cross the street properly;

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.910
and to do all the other things during your
days, your weeks, your months that you have

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.530
to in order to stay alive and fundamentally,
in some sense, propagate.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.190
Alright, so we’ll start with the neuropsychological
argument.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.930
Now we’ve already established the idea that
these little frames of reference, or maps,

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:40.410
or stories, or whatever you call them – I’ll
call them stories from hereon in, are little

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.360
gold-directed units.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.569
They’re units of conception and emotion
and perception and behavior; they’re little

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.170
sub-personalities.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.050
The sub-personality has an initial starting
point and a destination point, and then it

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.239
implements behaviors to transform the starting
point into the destination point.

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.150
Then you might say, well what forms these
little sub-personalities?

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.430
The answer to that is very complex, but one
answer is: fundamental motivations.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:20.400
I arranged the fundamental motivations on
this particular diagram pointing out that

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.620
you can roughly consider motivations, as those
that maintain you, and those that propagate

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.620
you.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.270
Now it’s just a heuristic, it’s just a
way of thinking about it.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.740
Under self-maintenance there’s thermal regulation,
thirst, hunger and elimination, and there’s

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.889
all sorts of other things as well, but those
will do for the time being.

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.750
Under self-propagation there’s affiliative
desire and sexual desire.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:52.669
The things that’s quite interesting about
all of this is that there are brain structures

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.949
that underlie the manifestation of these fundamental
sub-personalities.

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:03.620
Now people tend to think about them either
as motivations or emotions, and I think that’s

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.409
another useful heuristic.

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:10.099
You can say that, roughly speaking, that a
motivation pops up an entire frame of reference

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.099
and emotion tends to orient you within that
frame of reference.

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:20.710
But that’s only a conceptual simplification,
because what you see when look at the actual

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.699
brain structures is that there isn’t an
emotion center – there are a bunch of micro-units

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:35.570
in the brain, and there are separable micro-units
for different emotions and different motivations

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.810
and they don’t necessarily have that much
in common in terms of their locale, except

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.659
that they tend to be relatively deep in the
brain.

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.800
Some are hypothalamic and some are in the
amygdala, and some are in the periaqueductal

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.580
grey, which seems to be responsible for pain
responses.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.530
So we can classify things as motivations and
emotions, but it doesn’t map one-to-one

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.110
on the underlying brain structure.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.629
Now I think what we’ll do with regards to
talking about the brain is we’ll start from

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:04.659
the bottom up.

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:09.680
It’s appropriate to start from the bottom
up because you are more dependent on your

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.749
ancient brain structures than you are on your
modern brain structures; in that, if you damage

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:20.050
your modern brain structures, and I mean relatively
modern, let’s say the ones that have really

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.569
evolved in great detail over the last two
million years, the cortical cap, in particular,

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:28.699
the prefrontal cortex, a lot of the visual
cortex.

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.240
If you damage that you can pretty much go
on.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.899
Now you’re going to have one impairment
or another impairment, but you can still stay

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:35.899
alive.

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:40.099
However, there are structures that are lower
down that if you damage, that’s the end

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.099
of you.

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:45.219
So for example, the ascending reticular activating
system, which is the thing that wakes you

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:49.939
up when you’re asleep at night, when a noise
occurs that shouldn’t occur.

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:53.529
It seems to be the activating center for consciousness,
whatever that means.

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:58.219
It’s way deep down in the brain, it’s
way deep down at the top of the spinal cord,

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:59.639
roughly speaking.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.899
If you twist your head in a car accident a
little bit too roughly, and you sheer off

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:08.379
the ascending fibers, and you’re in a coma
permanently, then nothing can wake you up.

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:14.020
That’s pretty interesting – to know that
consciousness, our tendency is to think about

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.400
that as a function of the higher cortical
systems, is dependent completely on something

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.279
that is unbelievably ancient.

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:27.469
So it begs the question, exactly what level
of neuronal complexity do you have to be before

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:28.939
you have sub consciousness?

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:32.069
The answer to that is, we don’t know.

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:36.580
The relationship between consciousness and
neuronal structure is insanely complex.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:45.419
For example, you have very neuron-heavy structures
in your brain, like the cerebellum, which

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:51.279
has a very rough outer-coating like the cortex,
and it has about as many neurons as the cortical

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:52.430
sheet does.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.610
Yet, you can take it out of people and they
don’t seem to show any impairment in consciousness,

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.419
but they get ataxic and they can’t control
their behavior that well.

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:04.680
They have a hard time guiding it – but that
seems to be more or less it.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.240
Now it isn’t, because there are other things
that the cerebellum does, but my point is

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:15.319
that you can have massively neuron-heavy structures
that seem to be related in very minimal ways

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:17.889
to our experience of consciousness.

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:21.440
Your autonomic nervous system is sort of like
that – there are a lot of neurons in your

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.970
autonomic nervous system, but I think it’s
a mistake to say that we’re precisely conscious

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.449
of our autonomic nervous system; although
now and then we’re conscious of its outputs.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:35.669
It governs the operation of our organs and
all the things that are so complex that we

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.960
aren’t allowed to mess with them as conscious
beings.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.690
But it’s not conscious, and then somehow
some neurons are conscious.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.960
I tell you, we don’t know anything about
consciousness.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.990
We really don’t, we don’t have a clue.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:54.220
I think it’s probably because we’re formulating
the question wrong.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.460
There are people who are materialist reductionists,
and they believe that consciousness is an

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.470
emergent property of the underlying neuronal
function.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:08.310
The problem with that philosophy is that it’s
predicated on the assumption that they understand

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.070
what the matter is that’s making up that
neuronal substrate.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.720
I can tell you that by the time we’re able
to reduce consciousness to its underlying

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.750
material structure, we’ll think of whatever
matter is, in a way that’s completely different

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.140
than the way we think of it now.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.680
So there might be an eventual reduction, but
at the same time there’s going to be a transformation

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.980
of the theories.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:34.001
It’s clear that we don’t understand material
that well, particularly because when you go

00:09:34.001 --> 00:09:40.110
down to the tiny underlying substructures
at the subatomic level it behaves in a very,

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.090
very peculiar manner.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.610
So anyways, all bets are off in regards to
consciousness.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:52.890
It also does seem to be something that’s
likely very ancient.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.830
There are people who have attributed consciousness
to insects.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.360
Insects, by the way, seem to go out of their
way to take hallucinogenic drugs, which is

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.380
quite interesting.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:07.570
So the fly agaric, for example, is the famous
red and white mushroom that you always see

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.710
in fairy tales and in super Mario brothers.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.540
It pops up everywhere.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:17.140
Flies will come and take a bite of it and
they fall unconscious beside the mushroom

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:22.470
and they stay there for ten or fifteen minutes,
and then they get up, but they go eat it again.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:27.530
Reindeer really like them too and they get
blitzed out of their mind on amanita muscaria.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:34.220
There’s evidence for the desire to transform
states of consciousness, way, way down in

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.720
the animal kingdom, way farther than you’d
think.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.000
So God only knows.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.200
Then you think well a big brain is necessary,
but if you consider something like Irene Pepperberg’s

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.410
African Grey parrot, which died a couple of
years ago – a famous animal which could

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.220
speak better than a three year old kid.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:59.100
It had a good vocabulary, more than five hundred
words, and it could put together meaningful

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.100
phrases.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.510
It could speak better than a chimpanzee.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.700
They use sign language of course.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.000
This was one smart bird.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.900
If you think about a bird, it has no brain,
a bird.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.500
It’s got a brain about this big.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.650
I know a bird isn’t very big, and that actually
makes a difference.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:20.620
The fact that that much intelligence could
be compacted in that small of an area, means

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.170
as far as I’m concerned, that we don’t
really understand very much about how the

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.760
brain works.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.470
We do understand some things, and most of
the things we understand have actually been

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.870
discovered by animal experimentalists.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.470
Which is a useful thing to know.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.910
Because of course there are a lot of people
who think that animal experimentation isn’t

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:44.720
a good idea, or that we could substitute computer
models – which is a spectacularly idiotic

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.720
theory.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.670
Obviously if we had accurate computer models
we wouldn’t need to do the animal experimentation.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:54.790
We’re not going to build a computer model
that’s better than our current understanding,

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.540
at least not yet; we may in the future.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:09.790
Anyways you can think of the basic structures
that are producing these little sub-personalities

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.210
as the output of fundamental biological systems.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.910
They’re either motivations or emotions.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:19.480
The structure that appears to be most responsible
for this sort of thing, at least initially,

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.480
is the hypothalamus.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.260
I should show you a little bit about the hypothalamus.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:28.010
Just so you kind of have a sense of what it
is.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:34.180
It’s not very big, and you’ll see in this
diagram that it sits right on top of the spinal

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.170
cord and the base part of the brain.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.690
That’s just that little bitty area there.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:44.650
It looks from the diagram it seems to be about
one percent of the entire brain mass or something

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.650
like that.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.060
I think I mentioned to you before that if
you take a cat and you take all of its brain

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.490
off, except for the hypothalamus, roughly
speaking, as long as it’s a female cat in

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:59.710
a restrictive environment, it can pretty much
live a cat life; except that it’s hyper-exploratory.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.300
Which I do think is quite remarkable, because
you’d think that it would just lay there

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.100
passively, since it doesn’t have a brain.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:13.660
The hypothalamus, I’ll show you some more
pictures here of the hypothalamus, this is

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.820
a rat hypothalamus, and this is a diagram
from Larry Swanson, who’s a real genius,

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.960
and well-worth reading, although very complicated.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:27.450
He’s a developmental neuro-anatomist, if
I remember correctly, and he’s interested

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.940
in how the brain unfolds across the course
of fetal development in all sorts of different

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.040
animals.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.650
Assuming by doing that in part, you can track
the evolution, but you can also understand

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.430
the relationship between one brain part and
another.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:48.310
What you see here, you see all of these little
sub-units of the hypothalamus, they’re indicated

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:54.940
in orange, green and black, and so the first
thing that you can see is the hypothalamus

00:13:54.940 --> 00:14:02.050
is not one thing, it’s a bunch of ganglia,
I think is the correct name for the hypothalamic

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.050
sub-organs.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:10.310
So, it’s called a hypothalamus sort of for
convenience sake, you can identify it anatomically

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:17.920
and it might be a good short-hand for a rough
description of the macrostructure of the brain,

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.050
but of course the problem with the brain is,
you know, it’s pattern one at this level

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.370
and it’s pattern two at this level, and
it’s pattern three at this level.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.920
You can go a long ways down before you run
out of complexity.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.930
A cell is an unbelievably complicated thing,
and you have, God only knows how many of those

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.230
things you have in your brain.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:40.100
I don’t remember exactly what the latest
estimates are, but it’s in the hundreds

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.100
of billions.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:47.860
Each of those cells is as complex as really
complex factory, and it’s full of these

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.390
little molecular machines and they’re doing
things that are so complicated and amazing,

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:57.240
you just can’t believe it when you – I’ve
seen computer animations of some of these

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:04.430
structures in operation, and the complexity
of what they do to take the DNA molecule apart,

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:09.590
and then to rebuild it little bit by little
bit, and to do error correction at the same

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.970
time, it just boggles the mind.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:19.520
I cannot see how you can possibly account
for that using a straight, sort of Newtonian

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:25.560
deterministic model of clock ward behavior;
the stuff is so sophisticated.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:32.150
It looks more like advanced robotics than
it does the interaction of tiny little molecules.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:36.990
There are molecules that work with the DNA
that can walk, and as they walk they carry

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:41.920
other molecules, and not only can they walk,
they can walk over obstacles.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.990
They’re like made out of ten molecules!

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.500
What’s going on?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.560
It’s just beyond belief.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:57.270
Okay, so all of these little nuclei in the
hypothalamus, they’re all doing slightly

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:02.730
different things, they’re radically different
things, although they have commonality in

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:03.730
function.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:08.410
So, roughly what you could say is that one
half of the hypothalamus is devoted to popping

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:19.529
up little sub-personalities that are devoted
to the satisfaction of fundamental biological

00:16:19.529 --> 00:16:21.089
requirements.

00:16:21.089 --> 00:16:28.650
It’s not obvious what a fundamental biological
requirement is, because that’s a heuristic,

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:35.800
it’s not a category, it’s a fuzzy category,
but we can agree on some of its contents.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.930
So of course thirst, hunger and the need to
breathe would be in there, and might also

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:46.660
add pain, and sexual desire and the need for
play, although that’s a separate circuit

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.700
and it’s not mediated by hypothalamic structures,
there’s a different circuit for play.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.150
Play slash affiliation.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:04.860
Roughly speaking what an animal basically
chases and requires on a day-today and week-to-week

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.980
basis is mediated in large part by the hypothalamus.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:14.740
And the hypothalamus is also a crucial nexus
in the brain for identifying what’s going

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.309
on in the body and then telling the brain
what to do about it.

00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:21.889
So for example the hypothalamus is the thing
that makes you hungry and the thing that makes

00:17:21.889 --> 00:17:22.889
you thirsty.

00:17:22.889 --> 00:17:29.350
It does that because it monitors levels of
substances such as sugar in your bloodstream,

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:35.309
and also the degree to which you’re hydrated.

00:17:35.309 --> 00:17:40.950
You can sustain tiny little bits of damage
to the hypothalamus, which has unbelievably

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.340
extreme consequences.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:50.620
So for example, if you get unlucky, you can
develop hyper aphasia or, uncontrollable thirst.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:56.710
If that part of your hypothalamus is damaged,
people just can’t keep you away from water

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:01.289
supplies, you’ll just drink and drink and
drink and drink until you drown.

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:02.799
You can’t control it.

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:06.769
So the hypothalamus is no joke and hyperphagia
is the same thing, except in relationship

00:18:06.769 --> 00:18:08.419
to food.

00:18:08.419 --> 00:18:16.080
There have been reports of people who developed-
I knew a guy in Montreal, who used to work

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.080
at Harvard.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.580
His name was Frank Irvin.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:24.960
He did some of the earliest studies in the
world on the physiology of violent crime.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:32.460
Frank had identified the role of epilepsy
as a progenator to violent crimes.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.630
The defense rage circuit is part of the hypothalamus
and if you’re unlucky you can have a particular

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.809
form of epilepsy that will activate the defense
rage system.

00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:46.669
I knew someone who had a seizure condition
like that.

00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:49.990
Then they get uncontrollably aggressive.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.590
Now this guy has quite an interesting story.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:57.200
So it first happened to him when he was about
eighteen.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.940
He was out drinking in a bar.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.210
Now, alcohol lowers your seizure threshold.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:09.980
So he’s out drinking in a bar and all of
a sudden he got up and tore his shirt off.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.360
He was in an aggressive stance and backed
into the corner, and his friends were coming

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.470
towards him.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.899
He told them to go away or I’ll hit you.

00:19:17.899 --> 00:19:23.019
Now he was a very well socialized person,
so I think what happened is he went into this

00:19:23.019 --> 00:19:28.340
defensive rage state, but because he was so
well socialized, he could tell people to stay

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.149
away from him, but he couldn’t stop himself
from hitting them and attacking them if they

00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:33.799
got close enough.

00:19:33.799 --> 00:19:38.899
So anyways, I believe at that point he slapped
a police officer who came to rescue him.

00:19:38.899 --> 00:19:44.220
They took him to the hospital and on the way
there he hit his fingers against the hood

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:49.340
of the car and put dents in it, and then when
he got to the hospital – now I don’t remember

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.869
the particulars of this – but he picked
up a kidney bowl, which is like an enamel

00:19:53.869 --> 00:19:57.710
covered steel bowl, and twisted it in a figure
eight.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.899
It’s like, try that, it’s not so easy.

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:07.539
The next time it happened he was in another
bar, so what the hypothesis was then, was

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:13.799
that someone had spiked his alcohol with some
sort of drug, but that was never demonstrated.

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:18.960
He got off of all that because he had no record,
he was a perfectly peaceful person.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.440
Then the next time it happened he was in another
bar, and he did the same thing.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.659
He backed into the corner and he ripped off
his shirt, and he told me that when he was

00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:29.629
looking, he looked down the hallway and all
he could see was fire.

00:20:29.629 --> 00:20:36.013
A policewoman came to get him, because the
bar called the police, and he hit her.

00:20:36.013 --> 00:20:41.169
Then after that he had EEG testing, which
showed that he was susceptible to seizures

00:20:41.169 --> 00:20:42.440
so he swore off alcohol.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.809
He never had another drink and he’s like
thirty-five now.

00:20:44.809 --> 00:20:47.570
He never had another drink in his life and
it never happened again.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:53.090
It’s just a good example of – there was
a kid at the University of Texas, at Austin,

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:58.140
about thirty years ago, who seemed to have
a perfectly reasonable family life and so

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:02.450
far, a reasonable upbringing, and he started
to become increasingly violent in his fantasies.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:07.429
He climbed up onto the tower, because there’s
a high tower at the University of Texas at

00:21:07.429 --> 00:21:11.039
Austin, and he took at high-powered rifle
and I think he shot sixteen people before

00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:13.029
they finally got him.

00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:16.410
When they did an autopsy, they found he had
a high-pressing tumor that was growing on

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.020
the hypothalamus.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.629
The hypothalamus is no joke.

00:21:20.629 --> 00:21:25.759
For those of you who’s introduction to neuropsychology
has made you assume that the cortex is in

00:21:25.759 --> 00:21:33.279
control, let me tell you, the cortex is only
in control when all of your other basic requirements

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:35.110
are satiated.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.990
Since you’re a modern person, and you live
in luxury, that’s unparalleled in the history

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:47.450
of the world, all of your fundamental biological
sub-personalities are always satiated.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.500
That’s what you think you’re like.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:55.749
You’re only like that because you’ve never
been anywhere where you weren’t like that.

00:21:55.749 --> 00:22:02.000
So anyways, here’s one of the things that’s
cool about the hypothalamus.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.879
The first thing is that you have these different
sub-systems, these different nuclei that are

00:22:05.879 --> 00:22:08.539
responsible for these different sub-personalities.

00:22:08.539 --> 00:22:13.389
Oriented towards sexuality, oriented towards
hunger, oriented towards thirst, oriented

00:22:13.389 --> 00:22:16.659
towards temperature regulation, etc.

00:22:16.659 --> 00:22:21.580
I think of them as sub-personalities because
they have a viewpoint, they want something

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.730
and they want to go somewhere, they want to
accomplish it efficiently, and they have emotions

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:30.369
that go along with it so, you know, if you’re
going for some water and you drop your glass,

00:22:30.369 --> 00:22:33.950
or somebody gets in your way, or the tap isn’t
working, you’re going to feel frustration,

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.500
anxiety and irritation.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:42.059
They come fulyl equipped with emotions, they
have their own motor outputs, so they basically

00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:48.779
prime, and those would be the motor outputs
that are aggregations of habits that you have

00:22:48.779 --> 00:22:54.690
been able to learn that have aided you previously
in your water-searching behavior.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:58.730
So for us, that would be getting a glass out
of the cupboard, which is a gripping issue,

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.519
and a transport issue, and then you have to
turn on the tap.

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:08.919
Luria, who’s a famous Russian psychologist
called those things Kinetic Melodies.

00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:13.630
If you think about it from a Piagetian perspective
and a Lurian perspective at the same time,

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:20.490
you think how Piaget talked about how children
put together basic – they’re not reflexes

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.419
exactly, they’re complex sequences of what
started as reflexes.

00:23:24.419 --> 00:23:30.429
Then those can be linked together in a sort
of dance that you’re always doing with your

00:23:30.429 --> 00:23:31.429
body.

00:23:31.429 --> 00:23:36.950
Each of those little dances, you think water-seeking,
you’re going to have a set of water relevant

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:41.759
dances that you can do that your experiences
taught you to become an expert at.

00:23:41.759 --> 00:23:44.390
When you get thirsty those are likely disinhibited.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:50.299
That’s my guess, they’re disinhibited
and prepared for execution.

00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:55.320
Then the specifics of the circumstance that
you’re in will determine which ones are

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.529
disinhibited enough to actually run.

00:23:56.529 --> 00:23:59.659
It’s like you’re full of little machines
and they’re all on.

00:23:59.659 --> 00:24:06.570
They’re ready to go, but they’re all held
in stasis in some sense by some cortical inhibition.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.309
I like to think of the brain sort of like
a nuclear reactor.

00:24:09.309 --> 00:24:13.859
The core is really active, it’s on, but
then you have all of these rods going into

00:24:13.859 --> 00:24:17.970
the core to keep it from going critical.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:21.919
The cortex is sort of like that in relationship
to the lower parts of the brain.

00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:24.590
Those parts of the brain, man, they’re alive.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.970
They’re like the Titans of mythology.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:31.529
They’re sitting down there, these fundamental
forces and they’re ready to leap into action

00:24:31.529 --> 00:24:33.029
at a moment’s notice.

00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:39.500
But the cortex basically keeps them inhibited,
and it seems to do that – so imagine that

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.909
you have a vision of your desired future.

00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:49.330
Then a vision of the transformation stages
that you’re going to undertake to move from

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.159
where you are to that desired future.

00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:57.799
Then what you’re doing is you’re comparing
your interpretation of the present to your

00:24:57.799 --> 00:25:00.870
interpretation of the desired future.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:07.190
As long as those two things match, which the
hippocampus is the thing that’s determining

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:11.899
that, it’s the thing that’s computing
the match between your fantasy of what you

00:25:11.899 --> 00:25:15.419
want to happen with your fantasy about what
is happening.

00:25:15.419 --> 00:25:21.950
As long as that matches then the hippocampus
basically, now we don’t know exactly how

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:25.620
this works, although it seems to work to some
degree through modulation of the reticular

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:32.409
activating system – if the hippocampus matches
what you want with what’s happening, then

00:25:32.409 --> 00:25:35.630
all these other little sub-systems basically
turn off.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:41.049
If the hippocampus detects a mismatch, which
is when novelty occurs – something went

00:25:41.049 --> 00:25:45.120
wrong, then you get disinhibition of the reticular
activating system.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.139
It’s like you wake up, and then everything
is primed for action.

00:25:49.139 --> 00:25:52.940
That solves the problem of what you should
do when you don’t know what to do.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.519
The answer is, you should get ready to do
everything.

00:25:56.519 --> 00:26:03.139
You should be on alert and ready to implement
whatever actions – it’s not even whatever

00:26:03.139 --> 00:26:10.039
actions, it’s more like you should be ready
to implement whatever sub-personalities the

00:26:10.039 --> 00:26:14.850
situation seems to call for, as soon as you’re
able to identify what they are.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.440
Otherwise it’s sort of like an army that’s
on alert.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.489
You don’t know who’s going to be called
on, but everybody should be ready.

00:26:20.489 --> 00:26:24.029
That’s a high stress situation.

00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:29.110
Okay, so part of the hypothalamus, let’s
say for the sake of argument, it’s popping

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:33.210
up all of these little sub-personalities that
have to do with basic instincts.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:40.330
The words are all wrong because they’re
not – an instinct sounds like a drive and

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:41.840
people aren’t driven.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.249
We’re not that simple, we’re much more
flexible than that.

00:26:45.249 --> 00:26:46.649
Even rats aren’t driven.

00:26:46.649 --> 00:26:52.840
There’s a very seminal experiment that was
done at the height of behaviorism.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:58.119
So the idea with behaviorists, perfectly smart
idea, was that the way a rat learned was,

00:26:58.119 --> 00:27:03.379
it would start with a reflex, sort of in the
Piagetian sense, and then you could teach

00:27:03.379 --> 00:27:08.259
it a new routine which was an aggregation
of little, tiny reflexes, you could teach

00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:10.359
it a new routine by rewarding it.

00:27:10.359 --> 00:27:14.230
So let’s say, here’s what you do with
a rat: so you want to teach the rat to climb

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.749
the ladder and go across it.

00:27:16.749 --> 00:27:23.409
So the rat’s sniffing around in the little
rat cage.

00:27:23.409 --> 00:27:27.010
Then it gets close to the ladder, so you give
it a food pellet.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:29.549
Then it hangs around close to the ladder.

00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:36.080
It’s because you’ve reinforced the manifestation
of those micro-behaviors that are associated

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.080
with the ladder.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.429
Then maybe at some point the rat puts a little
paw up on the first rung, so you give it a

00:27:41.429 --> 00:27:42.429
food pellet.

00:27:42.429 --> 00:27:44.250
Then the rat is going like this very frequently.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:48.450
Then the next thing that happens is it puts
two paws up there, and you know if you’re

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:53.990
patient, using reward you can get that damn
rat to do damn near anything.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:28:00.059
Skinner taught pigeons to navigate guided
missiles by maps in the Second World War,

00:28:00.059 --> 00:28:01.059
by pecking.

00:28:01.059 --> 00:28:03.799
They never did use them, but really that’s
pretty impressive.

00:28:03.799 --> 00:28:07.869
You think pigeons are stupid, they’re not
stupid they can read maps, which is pretty

00:28:07.869 --> 00:28:10.419
damn amazing.

00:28:10.419 --> 00:28:15.830
So the idea was is what the animal is doing
is chaining together deterministic reflexes.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:21.220
The thing about a deterministic reflex is
that it’s not flexible right?

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.879
If it’s a deterministic reflex, it really
is a drive.

00:28:24.879 --> 00:28:30.470
Action A initiates Action B, which initiates
Action C and it’s a fixed action pattern.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.639
Some animals do seem to learn that way.

00:28:32.639 --> 00:28:34.049
There are these little animals.

00:28:34.049 --> 00:28:37.820
I think they’re moles that do this, it’s
shrews.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:48.190
Let’s say you teach a shrew to go from point
A to B by a very inefficient maze-like route.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:54.220
But the shrew could just walk straight there,
but once he learns to do this, but he can’t

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.309
figure out that he’s going from here to
here.

00:28:56.309 --> 00:29:02.320
Whereas if you train a rat to do this the
rat will figure out, to hell with all of this

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.809
circuitousness, it’s just going to go straight
from point a to point b.

00:29:05.809 --> 00:29:17.200
that finding was part of what indicated to
early neuro-psychological researchers that

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.120
animals produced a map of the environment.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.619
In some sense what we’re talking about when
we’re talking about these structures, the

00:29:24.619 --> 00:29:26.710
A to B structure, is a map.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:30.260
That’s another way you can look at it.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.119
So you’ve got this rat and it’s behaviors
are all chained together.

00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:37.460
So I already told you, I spoiled the story
in some sense, because I told you that the

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.840
rat could learn to take a short cut.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:45.609
One of the earlier demonstrations of the independence
of rat learning from the reflex of conditioning

00:29:45.609 --> 00:29:48.809
was that - so let’s say you’ve trained
a rat to run down a maze.

00:29:48.809 --> 00:29:53.299
Okay so hypothetically it’s using it’s
front legs and it’s back legs and it’s

00:29:53.299 --> 00:29:55.109
learned to chain all of that together.

00:29:55.109 --> 00:29:57.269
“Front leg, back leg, movement, turn left.

00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:59.749
Front let, back leg, movement, turn right.

00:29:59.749 --> 00:30:00.749
Etc.”

00:30:00.749 --> 00:30:04.429
so then, what if you put the rat, you tie
up it’s back legs and you put him in a little

00:30:04.429 --> 00:30:09.179
rat wheel barrel, so it’s got wheels instead
of legs – it’s like the rat zooms through

00:30:09.179 --> 00:30:10.269
the maze.

00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:17.029
So much for the reflex theory because obviously
you didn’t train the rat to use a cart with

00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:21.610
it’s rear-end stuck in it, it figured that
out all by itself.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:26.650
So anyways there is a system in you that allows
you to chain reflexes together.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:30.559
It’s a very primordial reflex system and
the behaviorists got that right.

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:35.049
It’s fast, very very fast, because it requires
few neural connections.

00:30:35.049 --> 00:30:42.299
So there are some advantages to simple learning
but once you get up to even the moderately

00:30:42.299 --> 00:30:49.620
higher cortical and sub-cortical functions,
you’re past the point of mere reflex chaining.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:55.830
Okay so, let’s for the sake of simplicity
the hypothalamus says, you need water.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.630
So you’re current state is that you’re
thirsty and you’re desired state is you

00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:59.879
get to go to the tap.

00:30:59.879 --> 00:31:05.119
You can feel your mouth dry and so forth,
and some fantasies of drinking water start

00:31:05.119 --> 00:31:09.200
to come to your mind, and then all of sudden
you’re kind of possessed by that.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:15.109
So it’s starting to interfere with your
conscious goal-directed behavior at that point,

00:31:15.109 --> 00:31:20.340
and finally it’s insistent enough like something
knocking at the door so you think, man I’m

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.340
thirsty.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.940
Maybe you enough think that you’ll work
better if you have something to drink.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:30.820
So you go off to the fountain, and what your
hippocampus is doing – you’ve got this

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.830
little idea, which is your desired future
which is about how this trip is supposed to

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:41.220
go, and then you’re watching to see how
the trip is actually going, but that’s an

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.440
interpretation too.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.389
If there’s a match between the two then
the hippocampus just leaves you the hell alone

00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:51.080
and you don’t get anxious, you don’t get
knocked off the track.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:56.700
You go there, you have the water, that satiates
that system, that’s a form of reward it’s

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.529
called consumeratory reward, and then that
systems disappears.

00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:05.529
It goes back to the dungeons from which it
emerged and in all likelihood another one

00:32:05.529 --> 00:32:06.529
pops up.

00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:12.639
Now, it’s an oversimplification of human
behavior to assume that you just go from one

00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:17.649
hypothalamically mediated state to another,
although I would say that’s what two-year

00:32:17.649 --> 00:32:19.249
olds do.

00:32:19.249 --> 00:32:21.340
In some sense, that’s what animals do.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:26.009
The two-year old’s doing it because that
little creature hasn’t gotten any more organized

00:32:26.009 --> 00:32:28.409
than hypothalamic.

00:32:28.409 --> 00:32:30.130
You can see this if you watch two year olds.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:31.340
It’s like they’re laughing and then they’re
crying.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.749
Then they’re hungry and then they’re hot
and then they need to go to the bathroom and

00:32:34.749 --> 00:32:36.080
then they want to play.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.710
It’s just one, pure, motivated or emotional
state after another.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.019
It’s quite fun to watch.

00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:46.570
They’re also relatively hyper-exploratory
and playful.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:51.899
They’re cycling through those things all
of the time.

00:32:51.899 --> 00:32:54.989
So you can’t say that that’s really what
an adult human does.

00:32:54.989 --> 00:33:03.340
The reason for that is that the problem with
the pure – the reason you need a cortex

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:08.190
and other sub-cortical structures that aren’t
hypothalamic is because the world is too complex

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:14.549
for those primordial systems to solve the
problems they’re supposed to solve A, in

00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:21.489
every possible situation, and B, across multiple
time frames, and C, in an environment that

00:33:21.489 --> 00:33:26.019
consists of the interactions between other
very complex beings.

00:33:26.019 --> 00:33:34.909
So it’s almost like an arm’s race of complexity
in some sense that’s driven our evolution

00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:40.099
– the smarter you get in some sense the
more variable you get.

00:33:40.099 --> 00:33:45.129
That’s a problem because as I got smarter,
say over the course of evolution, well you

00:33:45.129 --> 00:33:46.649
people got smarter too.

00:33:46.649 --> 00:33:51.580
We’re all competing and cooperating with
each other, so the whole damn system is getting

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.940
more and more complex.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:59.279
You have to grow a brain in order to manage
that at least, or you keep it simple – well,

00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:00.820
we didn’t keep it simple.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.899
So we decided to grow a brain instead.

00:34:02.899 --> 00:34:08.870
I don’t know if you know this but you’ve
looked at a chimpanzee – they don’t look

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:10.520
a lot like human beings.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:15.639
There are obviously some things in common,
their hands are quite human and their ears

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:21.100
are quite human, but their forehead comes
down to about here, and they’re kind of

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.540
shaped like this.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:29.810
They’ve got a huge, round body, and whereas
a human being is sort of like a stick with

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:33.930
two sticks coming out of it, and two more
sticks – we’re really, really thin, hardly

00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:35.630
any gut.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:41.120
Whereas a chimpanzee, it’s intestinal structures
are way, way, way longer than ours.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.300
So it has to pack that into this huge gut.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:47.800
A damn chimpanzee sits around for eight hours
a day chewing.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.280
The reason for that is it eats leaves.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.630
You go out into the forest and see how many
damn leaves you have to eat before you feel

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:54.980
full.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.962
All the chimp does is sit there and chew leaves.

00:34:57.962 --> 00:35:01.860
Then it has this huge gut so it can extract
some nourishment out of it.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:06.610
We figured out how to solve that problem once
we discovered fire and hunting, because we

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.140
could cook things.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:14.240
That enabled us, at least in principle, to
trade gut for brain, which I think was a pretty

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:20.340
useful trade, all things considered, although
it still might get us into trouble.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.370
The brain’s a very energy-hungry organ.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:28.020
We eat very, very efficient food and it turns
out that cooked food is much more nutritious

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.660
from a caloric perspective than raw food.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:37.080
You can afford to sit around and develop a
brain if you’ve got high-quality food.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:42.350
Otherwise you’re out there in the jungle
chewing on leaves like an idiot, it’s just

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.590
about as bad as pandas.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.300
Do you know why those things are damn near
extinct?

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.810
They used to be carnivores but all they eat
is bamboo shoots now.

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.510
That’s it, nothing else, bamboo shoots.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:57.780
They have no nutrition so they have to eat
bamboo shoots all day.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.040
Now and then the bamboo crop fails and there
aren’t any shoots.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.690
It’s like, so much for the pandas.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:08.210
If an animal ever deserved to go extinct it
was definitely the panda.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:13.040
Hunt something, the lazy bastards!

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:19.180
Anyways, now I discovered this about the hypothalamus
when I was ready Larry Swanson, it just bloody-well

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:23.650
blew me away, you’ll see why, at least in
part.

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:28.800
Half of the hypothalamus, roughly speaking,
is sort of devoted to popping up these basic,

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.240
primal sub-personalities; the sorts of things
that you share with animals.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.590
Then you might say, what happens when one
of those doesn’t work?

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.700
The answer is, well you get an anxiety response.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:45.020
Now, the anxiety response is not mediated
by the hypothalamus, and neither is pain.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:51.110
So, if you’re an idiot your body hurts you
or tells you or scares you.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:57.170
What’s interesting about that is the pain
systems and the anxiety systems are not in

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.760
the hypothalamus, they’re separate systems.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.400
The pain system is old, old, old.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.090
It may be as old as the hypothalamus, it’s
way down there in your brain.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:10.850
But, the anxiety system is a lot newer and
that kind of makes sense.

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:15.330
You can imagine the primordial organisms really
didn’t stop until they ran into something

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.800
that was hurting them.”

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.670
They couldn’t think, “oh no, I might run
into something that will hurt me.

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:25.490
You can’t think that roughly until you have
an amygdala.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:30.920
The amygdala is responsible for lots of things,
and all of these areas are interconnected.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.510
One of the things it seems to be responsible
for, at least impart, is anxiety.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:42.120
When your hippocampus detects a mismatch between
what you want to have happen and what is happening,

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.900
it disinhibits the reticular activating system,
and one of the things it activates is the

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:46.900
anxiety system.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:51.360
The anxiety system says, “stop, you idiot,
you don’t know where you are or what you’re

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.050
doing and so you should quit before you get
into trouble.”

00:37:54.050 --> 00:38:00.410
We don’t like that feeling very much, that
freezes us, but it’s better than pain.

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:03.470
You feel anxiety so you don’t have to feel
pain.

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:13.110
Pain seems to occur when you encounter a stimulus,
let’s say a situation, where the stimulus

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:18.850
magnitude is sufficient to damage those parts
of you that are encountering it – so too

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:25.260
bright a light, too hot a flame, too cold
a piece of metal, too hot food, whatever.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:30.200
If it’s of sufficient magnitude to damage
you, you get a pain response out of that.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.460
The pain response is supposed to teach the
part of you that moves forward, not to do

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.530
that again.

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:39.580
The anxiety system responds to cues of pain.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:43.310
The pain system is pretty complicated as well.

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:46.600
Frustration is a pain-like stimulus.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.060
Disappointment is a pain-like stimulus.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.990
Grief and loneliness are pain-like stimuli.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:54.520
Depression is probably a pain condition.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:39:00.450
So even though the pain system is quite primordial,
it’s grown up like a complex tree, and it

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:03.620
consumes many different functions.

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:10.820
It’s still a very ancient system, whereas
the amygdalian system, which is newer, you’ve

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:15.330
developed over time to tell you what might
hurt you so that you can avoid contacting

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:16.330
it.

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:20.860
You’ve got your hypothalamus and it’s
telling you – it’s laying out these little

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:25.300
sub-personalities that are helping you deal
with the fundamental necessities of the word.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:30.540
The pain system is there to tell you when
you have encountered a situation that’s

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:35.640
harmful, the anxiety system is there to tell
you when you might going to encounter something

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.640
harmful.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.770
That’s the thing that’s activated when
there’s a mismatch.

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:45.090
The mismatch says you don’t know where you
are or where you’re going, and so you might

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:46.850
get hurt.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:52.600
The other thing that happens, roughly speaking,
is that when the hippocampus disinhibits the

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:58.710
reticular activating system that turns the
other half of the hypothalamus on.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:04.530
This is quite cool because the other half
of the hypothalamus is the place where the

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:07.300
ventral tegmental area is located.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:12.100
The ventral tegmental area is the part of
the brain where the dopaminergic tracks emerge,

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:19.930
and those are the tracks that you use A, to
explore, and B, to respond to cues of consumatory

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:20.930
reward.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:26.850
So what that means in non-technical language
is that when you encounter mismatch you get

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:31.440
anxious, which is what you should do, you
should stop, something’s wrong.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.590
As long as nothing else happens that’s painful
or threatening, than that system starts to

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:41.350
acclimatize, partly because you’re looking
around and thinking.

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:43.850
People often talk about this as habituation.

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:45.900
That’s a stupid idea.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.420
It’s habituation if you’re a sea slug.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:53.700
It’s not a habituation if you’re a person,
except that in very, very primordial reflex-like

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.380
levels of the nervous system.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:59.330
At the higher order levels that we’re talking
about, it’s learning.

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:02.110
If you stop and you’re anxious, what happens?

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:06.240
Well, generally speaking, you start thinking,
what the hell might be going on?

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:11.150
You’re running through all of these different
theories and part of the way that works is

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:16.720
that it’s partly a consequence of state-dependent
learning.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:22.700
If you’re anxious you’re going to be primed
to remember situations that you were anxious

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.250
in before.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.550
Why should you do that?

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:33.190
The reason for that is that “things that
make you anxious” is a category.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.120
It’s actually a category.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.790
We tend to think of categories as something
that exists in the objective world.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:42.470
That is not how your brain categorizes things.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:47.840
You have to learn that really painfully to
make objective categorizations.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.850
As far as your natural nervous system is concerned
all things that go “bump” in the night

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:54.910
are the same thing.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:55.910
What is that?

00:41:55.910 --> 00:42:02.020
It’s some bloody, horrible predatory, crocodilian,
dragon-like, monster that hides under your

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:05.050
bed and comes out and bites you when you’re
three.

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:10.550
I just read a little paper today about this
kind of cat that lived back when were still

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.590
figuring out how to use spears.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:18.160
This was a particularly nasty kind of cat,
and it preyed on us, roughly speaking.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.060
We didn’t get eaten by too many cats because
cats really can’t bite through the skull.

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:26.370
They could go for your neck but they didn’t
necessarily kill you.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:30.970
This cat had a mouth that fit right around
your skull and it had two teeth that went

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:33.180
in here and two teeth that went in here.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.430
It was a silent killer.

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:41.090
There is evidence that even children are capable
of recognizing the motion in pattern of a

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:47.400
predatory cat, and one of the hypotheses is
that we still have all of our primate ancestors

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.510
that didn’t get eaten by that particular
cat.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:57.430
We’re pretty damn good at detecting cats,
at least of that type, and we seem to have

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:00.880
conserved that ability at least to some degree.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:07.160
You think about a category, you might think
well there’s fish and there’s birds and

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:12.800
there’s mammals and there’s reptiles,
those are Linnaean classifications, they’re

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.500
based in some sense on Evolutionary divergence.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:21.170
Where they’re not, on morphology.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:23.430
Who cares about that?

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:27.810
Things that eat you, that’s a category.

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:29.380
You need that category.

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:32.470
The other category is also things that might
eat you.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:37.430
So things that eat you, those are things that
can hurt you and the things that might eat

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:40.670
you are things you haven’t classified yet,
but might be dangerous.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:45.120
That’s your brain’s natural category;
one of them.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.320
Then you might think well if that’s the
natural category, see that’s the sort of

00:43:49.320 --> 00:44:01.480
thing that the guy that wrote An Ecological
Approach on Vision Perception, he talked about

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.340
as an affordance.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:09.880
An affordance is something who’s meaning
you instantly perceive.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:14.080
So you might say, “No, no, no, you see a
cat.”

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.730
Then you infer that it might eat you.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.760
No, you see something that might eat you,
and then you might be able to figure out that

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:21.800
it’s a cat.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:27.770
It’s the “might eat you” that you see
first, no the damn cat.

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:36.480
This is a fascinating phenomenon because it
suggests, like the Heidigerians proposed,

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:41.870
that what you perceive first in the world
is meanings and out of the meanings you extract

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:42.870
objects.

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:45.130
It’s not the other way around.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:49.520
If you look at the way your brain is organized,
that’s how it works folks.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:56.620
The more primordial your brain system is,
which means the more ancient it is, the more

00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:00.000
its perception is action predicated.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.810
So for example, if you hear a loud noise behind
you and you startle, that’s your response.

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:10.650
So you’re going into a crouch where it would
be difficult for a tiger to bite your neck.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:15.330
You do that, man that’s way before your
thinking.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:18.890
It’s before your perceiving, consciously.

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:22.100
You’re not getting images or sounds at that
point.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.710
It’s so quick.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:27.580
That’s a category: things that make you
go like this.

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:29.710
That’s a good category.

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:32.860
The reason I’m making such a case about
that category is because that’s one of the

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:38.050
mythological categories: Things that go bump
in the night.

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:42.790
One of the things that primordial people were
trying to figure out is – you could think

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:47.380
of any old animal as figuring out how to escape
from a predator.

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.880
That isn’t what human beings wanted to figure
out.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.740
Not once we were able to abstract.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:57.580
What we wanted to do instead was to figure
out how to escape from the class of all things

00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:02.270
that could eat you; not just any particular
old thing, but all of them at once.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:04.520
That’s the advantage to categorization.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.720
Can we arrange things so that nothing could
eat us?

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.760
How do you go about doing that?

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:13.540
Believe me, we’ve been working on that problem
for a very, very long time.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:17.131
One of the answers we came up with, we’ll
get into this later, is the idea of sacrifice.

00:46:17.131 --> 00:46:21.290
Sacrifice is a very, very ancient idea.

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:23.580
I’ll just give you a bit of a preview.

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:28.750
It took me like twenty years to figure this
out.

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:31.120
Human beings discovered sacrifice a long time
ago.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.950
They acted it out before they understood it.

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:36.400
We act out lots of things before we understand
them.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.450
The idea is sort of well we can make a bargain
with God.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.070
You might say, well what’s God?

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:46.280
We’ll approach that problem later, it’s
a very complicated problem.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:53.711
One thing you could think of God as, is, God
is the anthropomorphic representation of the

00:46:53.711 --> 00:46:57.200
entire social structure across time.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.860
You might say, well God will reward you if
you behave properly.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.380
What does that mean?

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:08.500
Imagine you could conceive of everyone that
wasn’t you as one metaperson.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.060
Imagine that that metaperson is God.

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:12.460
You can make a deal with that thing.

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:19.820
You can say if I behave properly that metabeing
will respond positively to me in the future.

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.260
It’s true, right?

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.260
You know that.

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:27.500
If you make a promise to someone and you keep
it, something good is likely going to happen

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.280
to you in the future.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:34.660
So that’s a God the Father derivation – it’s
far more complicated than that, but that’s

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:35.970
not a bad point.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:41.540
We kind of figured out that we could bargain
with it across time and that would work.

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:46.160
I read a really interesting paper by someone
who’s actually a former student of mine,

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:50.970
Azim Shariff, and he analyzed the relationship
between criminal behavior and belief in Hell

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:53.030
across a whole set of countries.

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:57.890
I don’t know if it was an exhaustive analysis,
correlational analysis.

00:47:57.890 --> 00:48:03.210
It’s way more peaceful in countries where
people believe in hell.

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:07.250
You think should you believe in hell?

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:09.310
Yes and no.

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:13.200
Atheist arguments aside, we’re not even
going to bother with them because they’re

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.220
kind of moronic.

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:22.830
The idea here is that there are certain action
patterns that if you undertake, you will be

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:26.740
viciously punished in the future.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:31.070
You try lying to everyone you meet and see
how well you’ll do in a twenty-year period.

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:35.820
You’re going to be in such trouble by the
end of that twenty-year period that hell will

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:39.880
be the only accurate way to describe where
you’re situated.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:45.890
So it’s no joke these are real things and
people came up with these ideas for a reason.

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:50.520
Hell isn’t only where other people put you
if you’re bad, it’s a lot more profound

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:51.840
a concept than that.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.650
That’s not a bad start.

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:58.820
Anyways, the sacrificial notion was something
like we cannot do what we want to do right

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:02.170
now and do something else, and that will make
things better in the future.

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:03.440
Think about that people.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:07.650
That’s the most brilliant idea human beings
ever came up with.

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:11.950
There’s this old story, which is probably
not true, about how to catch a monkey.

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:17.480
You get this jar that’s got a pretty thin
neck.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:21.080
Just big enough for a monkey to put its hand
in, and you fill it with things monkeys like

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.080
to eat.

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.470
Let’s say hard candy for the sake of argument.

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:28.340
So you put that out there and the monkey goes
and sticks its hand in and grabs a bunch of

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.340
candy.

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:33.171
It can’t get its damn hand out because it’s
only big enough for it to put its hand in.

00:49:33.171 --> 00:49:34.610
so then you can just go and pick up the monkey.

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:37.240
Well, what’s the problem with the monkey?

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.220
It can’t sacrifice.

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:44.250
It won’t sacrifice its grip on the damn
candy for its future existence.

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:48.390
That’s what your parents have been teaching
you ever since you were little kids.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:51.150
Let go of the candy so that you can live.

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:53.680
That’s delay of gratification, right?

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:59.220
That’s contentiousness, that’s the discovery
of time and its relationship to the social

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:00.220
environment.

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:02.550
It’s so brilliant.

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.690
Part of what people were trying to figure
out when they were developing these rituals

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:11.140
of sacrifice is – okay, so you think about
society as a meta-person, it’s usually represented

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:15.450
as male by the way, but not always, it depends
on the circumstances.

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:18.820
So what does this meta-person want?

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.310
You have to try to figure that out.

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:26.460
Part of what it wants is – don’t eat all
the damn grain today, save some for next year,

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:27.480
right?

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:32.540
Act as if the future exists as part of the
social contact.

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:36.210
God, that’s such a discovery man.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:39.600
It’s only people who figured that out.

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:45.240
I mean squirrels have kind of got it in some
sense because they store nuts, and squirrels

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.560
are smart.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.910
They just kind of got the inkling of it.

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:52.710
I think what squirrels do is they eat all
of the nuts they can possibly eat right now,

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:54.450
and then they store the rest of them.

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:58.089
It wouldn’t go hungry if you store nuts
for the future, human beings will do that

00:50:58.089 --> 00:51:01.520
– don’t eat the seed grain, right?

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.740
Then you’re going to die next year.

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:07.270
Alright, so back to the hypothalamus.

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:11.869
Now, you’re doing something you want to
do and you’re tracking how that’s going

00:51:11.869 --> 00:51:15.260
– both of those are hypotheses, by the way.

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.110
All of a sudden something happens that you
don’t want to have happen, like you live

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:19.870
in Flint, Michigan for example.

00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:24.420
So you decide to go have some water and it
turns out that it’s not water at all, it’s

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:25.420
led.

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:30.560
I don’t know if you guys know about that,
but it’s just the sort of thing that makes

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:31.990
your jaw drop.

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:35.530
The state is in big trouble – Michigan.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:41.500
So they appointed an auditor to control finances,
I believe at the state level.

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:44.360
It might have been only at the city level,
but it doesn’t matter.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.520
Let’s say the state level.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.640
So the auditor was looking for ways to save
money and one of the ways they decided to

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:55.040
save money was to hook up Flint, Michigan’s
water supply to a river instead of to the

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.180
great lake, which is what it’s right beside.

00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:03.190
Turns out, since Flint was an industrial center
forever, that the water’s just full of led.

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:07.970
So now they have something like fifty thousand
led-poisoned people living in Flint, Michigan.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:09.660
That is not a good thing.

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:14.610
Led lowers your IQ rapidly and it makes you
violent.

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:18.960
For the ten thousand dollars they saved they
probably cost themselves half a million dollars

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.200
per person.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:26.150
It wasn’t actually that there was led in
the water it was that the water was more acidic.

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:29.510
Oh, it took the led out of the pipes, yeah,
good point.

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:34.900
Well I’m not here to complain about Michigan
politicians, the point is, is that just because

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:38.960
you think you’re out for a drink of water
that does not necessarily mean that’s what’s

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:39.960
going on.

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:45.020
That’s why I said that you’re comparing
your vision of the future to what you think

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:46.620
is going on right now.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:53.500
Now if you read the neuropsychologists like
Vinagradova, Sokolov and Jeffrey Gray, they’re

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.950
basically behaviorists.

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:59.910
So what they tell you is this – and this
is different – what they tell you is you

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:04.620
have this little expectancy map that’s like
the rat has of its surroundings – it’s

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.630
a spatio-temporal map.

00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:11.090
So when you’re doing something, you expect
a certain outcome, okay.

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:15.990
What you compare that to is reality as it
unfolds.

00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:20.490
So you could say, so you’ve got this map
and then stimuli appear to you, and those

00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:21.840
are objectively real.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.460
No, that’s wrong.

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.540
It’s wrong.

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:27.340
It’s interpretation everywhere.

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:31.220
You think you know what’s going on right
now and you think you know what you want.

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:36.160
The reason I’m making such a big deal out
of this is because look, if you’re a rat

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:39.601
and you’re going about your business and
something you don’t want happens, according

00:53:39.601 --> 00:53:47.880
to the Gray Behaviorist model, you have to
revamp your expectancy map.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.330
According to the model that I’m proposing
it’s way worse than that, because you don’t

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:53.010
know where the damn error is.

00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:57.590
It might be in the map of what you want, not
what you expect, that’s a different thing,

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:02.120
but it also might be in the map you have that’s
of the present.

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:07.430
So it’s not just the map that you have that’s
a prediction of your actions that’s at fault,

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:10.760
it could easily be the way you’re construing
the world right now.

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:17.500
It could be error at any level of behavior
and so what it means is when an anomaly occurs,

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:24.230
it spreads doubt through the entire hierarchy
that we were describing including the future,

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:27.100
the present and even the past.

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.040
You know this, you know this perfectly well.

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:33.240
You can see it when you encounter complex
anomaly.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:38.840
So a complex anomaly would be you have a long-term
relationship and you get betrayed.

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:44.030
So betrayed means you’ve trusted someone
and they enticed you to do so, and then they

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:47.420
exploit that trust and hurt you.

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:51.360
For Dante, the betrayers were in the lowest
circle of hell.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:55.350
So it’s a particularly nasty thing to do
to people.

00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:59.890
If you think about trust as the precondition
for interpersonal relationships, which it

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:05.180
is, then if someone acts towards you in a
way that violates your trust in trust, then

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:08.800
they’ve done you the worst disservice that
someone could possibly be done.

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.770
Okay, so you get betrayed.

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:11.770
Alright so, bang!

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:12.930
That’s an anomaly.

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:14.840
What does it imply?

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:17.290
That’s the wrong question.

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:20.840
The right question is, what doesn’t it imply?

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:25.070
It implies that you just don’t have the
foggiest notion of what you’re doing or

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:28.500
what human beings are like.

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:32.190
Especially if it’s a particularly vicious
betrayal, maybe you’ve been suckered by

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:37.250
a psychopath, it’s like, okay, update your
model and account for that – good luck,

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.210
especially if you’re naive.

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:44.770
The probability that you’ll be able to reach
down into the depths far enough to come up

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:49.690
with a coherent explanation for why someone
would do that is very, very low.

00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:54.260
What I’ve discovered in my clinical practice
is that if you get betrayed badly enough,

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:59.130
the only language that you can use to describe
it is fundamentally religious.

00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:02.930
At some points of betrayal it’s good versus
evil.

00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:04.270
It’s malevolence.

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:08.710
It’s the malevolence that really traumatizes
people.

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:12.420
It’s the fact that that person was out to
hurt you.

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:15.560
What’s a human being like when they’re
capable of that?

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.360
It’s an age-old question.

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.930
I’ll tell you something weird and interesting.

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:27.820
There’s this old idea in Genesis, one of
the first ideas in Genesis, is that God made

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:29.980
people a paradise to live in.

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:35.260
Let’s just be wild about this for a moment,
and assume that your little model when it’s

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:37.350
going well is a little paradise, right?

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:39.680
The world’s turning out the way you want
it to.

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:45.600
There’s a snake in there somewhere, and
that means – well, why is there a snake?

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.720
There’s a bunch of things you’re not paying
attention to while you’re going about your

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.050
business, right?

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:52.940
In fact, there are almost an infinite number
of things that you’re not paying attention

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:53.940
to.

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:56.740
The problem is that one of those infinite
number of things that you’re not paying

00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:59.570
attention to can shift on you all of a sudden.

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:02.970
So there’s always this snake in the garden.

00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:05.140
Then you have to figure out what to do with
it.

00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:09.400
The thing is, if you interact with the snake
you get more conscious.

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.560
The problem with that is you lose your little
paradise.

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:16.170
Okay, well it’s worse than that, because
that story is really old.

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:17.920
We have no idea how old it is.

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:23.810
It’s disseminated all over the world, or
it emerged independently in different places,

00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:24.810
we don’t really know.

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:26.310
In any case it doesn’t really matter.

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:30.990
It’s a fundamental enough story – tree
plus snake plus people – that no matter

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:34.830
where you go some people have tree snake stories.

00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:39.110
I think that’s because we lived in trees
for like thirty million years and we got eaten

00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:40.830
by an awful lot of snakes.

00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:44.380
So it’s a story that really appeals to us.

00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:48.780
Every bloody science fiction movie you go
to most of the time if the aliens are bad,

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:50.210
they’re always reptilian.

00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:56.440
You don’t get furry little koala aliens
that are chasing you around, it’s like the

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.440
one’s an alien.

00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:03.830
A reptile inside a reptile, they’re nasty
beasts, and they come out inside of you even.

00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:06.010
Which is another symbolic idea.

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:12.780
Okay, so you’ve always got the damn snake,
and it’s popping out all of the time, and

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:16.040
there’s nothing you can do about it except
getting ready to deal with snakes, no getting

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.040
rid of them.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.980
So that’ the first lesson, you’re not
getting rid of the damn snakes.

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.710
You better learn to deal with them.

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:27.480
Then the next question is, what is the worst
possible snake?

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:32.180
One of the things that happened in Christianity,
and this was influenced in part by Zoroastrianism,

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:37.590
was the idea of almost an independent evil
arose.

00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:42.740
In fact there was a branch of Christianity
called Manichaeism, that construed the world

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:47.320
as a battle between good and evil where good
and evil had equal reality.

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.600
They were in this eternal battle.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:55.070
Now that got wiped out by the standard Christian
theory that evil was actually just the absence

00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:59.600
of good, which anyways you could have a big
debate about that and people have for thousands

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.960
of years.

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:06.080
As Christianity developed, there’s this
weird mythology that grew up around the weird

00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.150
myth of Genesis.

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:13.420
The weird mythology was that the snake in
the Garden of Eden was also Satan, and that

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:15.110
he’s the king of all evil.

00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:16.430
Okay, what does that mean?

00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:17.690
It’s pretty straight- forward.

00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:20.740
What’s the worst predator?

00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:24.380
Well that’s easy, the worst predator is
a human being.

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:28.790
The worst of all possible snakes is the most
malevolent possible being.

00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:33.230
That’s exactly right, and that’s why that
association was made.

00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:38.020
It’s so interesting because it took people
thousands of years to make that association.

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:44.980
It wasn’t really put together well until
Milton formalized in Paradise Lost.

00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:49.190
We kind of observe this in action, that there
were bad people.

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:51.640
Okay, so bad is a category.

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.810
What does bad entail?

00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:59.380
Mythologies of evil center in on what constitutes
bad.

00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:04.430
Carnivorous might be one of the things; malevolent,
out to hurt, right?

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:09.410
Betrayal, lying, and all of the cardinal great
sins.

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.410
That’s the worst snake.

01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:14.690
It’s a psychologization of the idea of the
predator.

01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:21.120
It’s even more sophisticated than that,
because one branch of that theory is that

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.680
the worst predator is the evil force outside
of you, but the next branch of that is that

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.060
the worst predator is the evil force within
you.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:34.040
Yeah, well that’s when it gets really psychologized.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.760
You think, well is that superstition?

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.510
Hey, that’s not superstition boys and girls,
it’s a lot more intelligent than that.

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:46.870
It’s the most sophisticated theory of the
way things work that we have and it’s correct.

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:51.690
Now what that means from a metaphysical perspective,
we’re not going to talk about that because

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:57.070
we can, but we can certainly talk about what
it means in practical Darwinian terms.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:01.530
You better know what’s after you, and the
worst thing that could possibly be after you

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:06.360
is a fully motivated and completely malevolent
human being.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.440
Skull-crushing cats be damned.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.570
All they want to do is eat you, they’re
not going to torture you; whereas if you fall

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:17.530
into the hands of the wrong human being man,
you could be in excruciating pain for the

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:19.360
next twenty years.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.550
So people are very imaginative if they figure
out how to hurt someone.

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:29.030
They can keep it up for a long time, and they’re
fully motivated to do so under some conditions.

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:33.820
So you really got to watch out for that.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.530
Alright so back to the hypothalamus.

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:42.590
So when you have a mismatch between what you
desire and what you’re after, then the hippocampus

01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:45.660
says, “uh, we don’t know where we are.”

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.660
That’s what it says.

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.250
You no longer know where you are.

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:50.620
Okay, what should you do when you don’t
know where you are?

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.420
You should stop moving.

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.580
Then you should – well then what?

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:57.000
You should prepare to do a lot of things.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.140
Okay, then what?

01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.140
Then you should explore.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:04.380
Well that’s where the other half of the
hypothalamus comes in; that dopamanergic circuit

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:06.710
that mediates positive emotion, right?

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:10.860
Almost all the positive emotion that you experience
in your life, the kind you like, which is

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:19.450
hope and curiosity and expectation and surprise
and that’s all mediated by the dopamanergic

01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:20.450
systems.

01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:25.950
It’s a major-league contributor to the totality
of your being, especially in a positive direction.

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:31.710
That’s rooted in the hypothalamus, so what
that means is that, it’s quite cool, you

01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:36.520
got your fundamental motivations, you know
your basic biological motivations, “bang!”

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:41.320
they fail, that’s anxiety, that’s a newer
system, and exploration.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.450
That’s an older system.

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:47.140
That damn exploratory system has been there
forever.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:52.950
Now if you look at classic hero mythology,
which we’re going to do in great detail,

01:02:52.950 --> 01:03:00.270
what you see is that the typical myth of humanity
is we live in a place, we’ll say.

01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:09.860
We have to live in a place, and the place
is doing quite nicely, thank you very much.

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:12.490
The Hobbits and Frodo.

01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:15.970
So you’ve got the little shire there, right?

01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:19.750
It’s all peaceful, it’s full of these
little people who are a little on the arrogant

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:23.260
side, they’re kind of dopey, they have no
idea what the hell’s going on in the outside

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:28.750
world, but they think that’s okay, they
think you know, peculiar people are concerned

01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:29.860
about that sort of thing.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:34.410
They’ve got their little happy paradise
going, they live a long time, they eat a lot,

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:37.290
they party a lot.

01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:41.570
Unbeknownst to them, which is a very interesting
feature of the story, the only reason they

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:47.480
have any peace at all is because they’re
descendants of old kings, continually patrolling

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.440
the borders, right?

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.890
Those are the striders.

01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:56.740
Aragorn, he’s the member of the race of
old kings who patrols the borders.

01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:00.840
Those are ancestral figures, it’s like you
can all sit here in your little happy paradise,

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:06.660
but the only reason you can do it is because
the sons of great kings have put borders around

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:08.030
your kingdom.

01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:14.080
It’s funny because in the Hobbit, the Hobbit’s
basically despise the Strider, they’re very,

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.560
very suspicious of him.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.550
He’s kind of dirty and dusty and he looks
like he’s been banged around all over the

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:20.550
world.

01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:21.550
He’s sort of like a tramp.

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:25.430
They don’t know he’s the son of a great
king, good thing for them that he is, however.

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:29.250
Okay, so then you’ve got the little shire,
what happens?

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:31.300
Evil things are stirring.

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.340
What is it?

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.570
Well, fundamentally it’s a great dragon.

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:38.660
Well that’s a snake, except it’s like
a meta-snake.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:41.010
It’s snake with fire.

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:45.150
You can be sure that fire was not only one
of our greatest allies, but one of our greatest

01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:48.380
enemies, especially when we lived on the blank
in Africa.

01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:50.660
That thing would burn now and then.

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:54.510
So, get the hell away from that.

01:04:54.510 --> 01:05:02.140
So anyways, one hobbit, who’s woken up by
a wizard – the wizard is the symbol for

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.820
the self from the Jungian perspective.

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:07.920
So there’s one hobbit who’s a little bit
more creative and exploratory than the rest

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.460
and everybody has a little respect for him
but they think he’s pretty damn peculiar.

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:15.050
He decides that he’s going to, under the
tutelage of the wizard, he’s going to go

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:16.770
check out this dragon.

01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:20.830
So he leaves the borders and goes out into
the unknown.

01:05:20.830 --> 01:05:24.531
Then the rest of it is an adventure and one
of things that’s very interesting, again

01:05:24.531 --> 01:05:29.250
from a Jungian perspective, is that, what
does the Hobbit have to become in order to

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:30.730
conquer the dragon?

01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:32.610
A thief.

01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:37.250
Now that’s pretty weird, because you think
hey man, this guy’s out being a hero, so

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:38.630
he should be a hero.

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:41.760
No, he turns into a thief.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.760
Why?

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:47.820
Well it’s because if you’re going to conquer
a dragon you better be a hell of a lot tougher

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:49.590
than you are naive.

01:05:49.590 --> 01:05:54.400
So, partly what happens is, for the hobbit
to masker up the forces that are necessary

01:05:54.400 --> 01:06:05.290
for him to confront something that is that
fundamental, he has to transcend the cowardess

01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:07.340
that he describes as morality.

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:13.510
Okay, so Nietzsche for example, Nietzsche’s
often viewed as a critic of morality.

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:16.869
That’s not true.

01:06:16.869 --> 01:06:20.553
Nietzsche identifies morality with cowardess,
but that’s not what he does.

01:06:20.553 --> 01:06:27.869
What Nietzsche says is this: if you’re too
afraid to do something, so you won’t do

01:06:27.869 --> 01:06:33.020
it, then you’ll say that the reason you
don’t do it is because you’re moral.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:34.290
That’s not the reason.

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:36.590
The reason is that you’re too damn afraid
to do it.

01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:39.380
You might want to, but you’re too afraid.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.380
That doesn’t make you moral.

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:45.340
So what happens to the Hobbit, for example,
once he gets outside of the kingdom, he has

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:51.840
to develop a whole array of potentials that
he never developed before, because they were

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:58.940
either not necessary in his civilized place,
or because they were forbidden as immoral

01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:03.220
by the cultural situation that he grew up
in.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:08.850
You have to be touched by the snake in order
to defeat the snake.

01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:11.990
Where else have you seen that motif?

01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:13.200
Harry Potter, right?

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:17.990
Harry Potter’s a strange character because
he’s not obedient, not at all.

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:20.160
In fact, he’s quite disobedient.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:24.020
He breaks the rules in the service of higher
morality.

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:29.130
The higher morality is that he faces down
the dragon that paralyzes you, and he frees

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:30.130
the virgin.

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:34.780
That’s what happens with Ginny – Virginia,
Virgin, it’s the retelling of Saint George

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:35.780
and the dragon.

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:42.790
And interesting enough, the reason that Harry
Potter revivifies, is because Dumbledore’s

01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:45.850
phoenix comes by and cries in his wounds.

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:50.710
Well the phoenix is something that dies and
is reborn and so the meta-myth underlying

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:55.710
the second-volume of the harry potter series
is that the part of you sustains you through

01:07:55.710 --> 01:08:01.450
an encounter with a dragon that paralyzes,
is the part of you that can die and be reborn.

01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:06.011
What that means in a sense is if you’re
wrong about something, and you fall into a

01:08:06.011 --> 01:08:11.300
pit, then you should let go of what you’re
wrong about, so that something new can arise.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:17.980
So it’s better to be the thing that transforms
in response to catastrophe, than it is the

01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:20.080
thing that’s static.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.949
That’s another big discovery of people.

01:08:22.949 --> 01:08:29.040
We’re agents of transformation, which is
of course why kids are so bloody obsessed

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:32.880
with magicians and wizards, which are agents
of transformation.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.270
That’s all embedded in the mythology, it’s
all acted out.

01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:39.140
Nobody understands this sort of thing to speak
of.

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.920
Certainly the kids don’t, it just hits them.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.580
They can recognize the pattern.

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.920
They know that there’s something magical
about them, even though they’re living in

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:52.660
a cupboard in a London suburb, where everything
is boring and flat and under control.

01:08:52.660 --> 01:09:00.920
That’s not the real world, and it’s true,
it’s not.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:09.858
Is that why we have more patience for people,
including criminals, who admit their crime

01:09:09.858 --> 01:09:10.858
and do their punishment and redeem themselves?

01:09:10.858 --> 01:09:12.680
Oh not only patience, we often have admiration
for them.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:17.950
Oh yeah, how many movies feature attractive
bad guy?

01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:22.450
Well or for that matter, attractive bad woman?

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:26.140
It’s because of the Nietzchian observation.

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:30.130
The people who are good aren’t good, they’re
just cowards.

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:33.600
Whereas the guy who’s bad, well at least
he’s not a coward.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:38.180
Well then you might say, well you know, yeah
he could stop being a coward and also become

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:44.260
a good guy, but that’s often but not always
the actual plot of the movie.

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:46.859
That’s the redemption of the bad guy.

01:09:46.859 --> 01:09:51.670
It’s also what woman fantasize about in
relationship to the beauty and the beast mythology.

01:09:51.670 --> 01:09:53.290
They don’t want a coward.

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:55.350
He’s the guy that wants to be the friend.

01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:57.560
It’s complete bullshit.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:01.430
The bad guys going to advance over that – but
not a big enough advance because he’s a

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:02.430
bad guy.

01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:05.400
The best thing you want is a civilized bad
guy.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.570
That’s what you want.

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:10.830
Well no wonder, because it’s only a civilized
bad guy that’s going to be capable to be

01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:12.380
dealing with the dragons.

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:13.850
It’s right.

01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:18.880
Lloyd Axworthy, when he was the minister of
Foreign Affairs for Canada, we know the massacres

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.330
were going on in Yugoslavia.

01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:25.190
It was front-page news at one point.

01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:28.350
He said, “I don’t have the imagination
for that kind of evil.”

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:33.210
Oh well, that’s really impressive mister
minister of foreign affairs, did you ever

01:10:33.210 --> 01:10:34.270
read about the Holocaust?

01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:36.770
It’s like, it’s time to wake up a little
bit!

01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:39.810
These things happen, but he said it as a moral
claim.

01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:42.440
I just couldn’t imagine that sort of thing
happening.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.270
Well, you’re a little on the naïve said,
aren’t you?

01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:50.250
And parading that around as morality is not
a reasonable thing to do when you also happen

01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:52.400
to be Minister of Foreign affairs.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.790
You should be looking out for the snakes all
of the time.

01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:59.870
They’re definitely out there, and Milosevic
was definitely one of them.

01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:05.900
So if a naive person meets someone like that,
the naive person loses.

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:09.780
That’s not good because there’s lots of
people like that and it would be better if

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:11.320
they didn’t win.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:19.550
So anyways, the fact that the exploratory
circuitry is embedded into the hypothalamus

01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:25.110
way down there with lust and thirst and hunger,
it’s so great because it shows you how the

01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:26.350
mythology works.

01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:30.640
It basically says, okay, here’s a bunch
of things you’re doing now and then they’ll

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:31.640
go wrong.

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.330
You need a system to deal with things when
they go wrong.

01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:35.330
What’s the system?

01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:37.050
Well it might kill you, bang!

01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:40.450
You better have some pain and anxiety to protect
you.

01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:41.850
You better figure out what it is.

01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:45.330
Okay, better have an exploratory system so
that you can go out there and gather some

01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:46.560
more information.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:52.560
Well that’s the human story: gather information
in the face of danger.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.050
That’s the human story.

01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:56.730
That’s what we do.

01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:58.060
So that’s the hero myth.

01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:01.880
The hero myth is redemptive, and that’s
because it is redemptive.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:05.730
That is what works, or at least what we’ve
stated our being on.

01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:06.730
Who knows?

01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:09.310
Maybe all of this exploration will just get
us in trouble.

01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:11.790
That’s another part of genesis, right?

01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:13.850
Poke around and see what happens.

01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:15.590
Well you know you’re doing that all of the
time.

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:19.940
You‘re in your little paradise, beedling
away all happily, and then you just can’t

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:22.730
stop yourself from pulling on a thread somewhere.

01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:26.840
Then you find out, oh my God, then maybe that’s
when you get suspicious about your partner

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.840
cheating on you.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.330
You think, maybe this person’s cheating
on me, and you can’t leave it alone.

01:12:31.330 --> 01:12:34.670
You can’t leave it alone, you got to go
look at the snake.

01:12:34.670 --> 01:12:36.190
Turns out it’s there!

01:12:36.190 --> 01:12:38.600
Down you go into the underworld.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:45.690
You might think, maybe the bliss of ignorance
would have been better.

01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:49.120
Well, it’s not like psychologist don’t
tell you that.

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:52.360
All those positive illusion people, that’s
there whole shtick.

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:56.330
It’s better to be a little bit dumb about
how things work, because otherwise there’s

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:57.890
no way you can be happy.

01:12:57.890 --> 01:13:00.960
That’s an idiotic theory on two accounts.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:06.400
A, happy isn’t the point, and B, dumb is
not the goal.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.750
So it’s so ignorant that it’s actually
corrupt.

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:14.940
Which is really saying something, because
you have to be pretty damn ignorant before

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:16.510
you get to corrupt.

01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:19.730
So it’s a hell of a thing to teach people.

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:23.910
You have to delude yourself in a minor way
otherwise you can’t stand being alive.

01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:28.380
Oh my God, that’s awful, that’s really
awful.

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:32.130
Here’s a different story, maybe you’re
tough enough to open your eyes.

01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:34.290
That’d be a much better story.

01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:37.920
It’s possible too because people are really,
really, really tough.

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:42.360
It’s just that they live in these little
protected places and they never get out there

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:47.390
and hammer themselves out against the world,
so they never discover that they’re tough.

01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:48.620
You might thing, well that’s your opinion.

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:50.960
Well no, it’s not my damn opinion.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:56.260
We know that if you take someone who’s naïve
and paralyzed by anxiety, and you put them

01:13:56.260 --> 01:14:00.570
in psychotherapy and you expose them to the
things that they’re afraid of and disgusted

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:06.390
by and avoiding, that it isn’t that they
get less afraid, they get more confident.

01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:08.870
That’s what generalizes.

01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:12.150
If you bring someone in who’s got a mouse
phobia and you treat the mouse phobia, then

01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:14.370
they’re not as afraid of a bunch of other
things.

01:14:14.370 --> 01:14:15.550
Why does that happen?

01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:20.530
They weren’t afraid of the damn mouse, they’re
afraid of their own inadequacy.

01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:23.260
Then you teach them that they don’t have
to be afraid, and then they think , “hey,

01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:25.360
I don’t have to be afraid.”

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.989
Then they’re not afraid of a whole bunch
of things.

01:14:27.989 --> 01:14:31.640
So you get generalization from behavioral
exposure.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:37.260
There’s no question about whether or not
exposure to the things that you avoid is curative,

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:39.510
it’s the fundamental axiom of psychotherapy.

01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:43.380
That and figuring out what you’re going
to do with your future.

01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:46.260
Even in psychoanalysis it’s face what threatens
you.

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:49.760
It’s just that the psychoanalysts go after
past traumas.

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.010
It doesn’t matter as far as your brain is
concerned.

01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:58.060
A dangerous thing in the past is exactly the
same thing as a dangerous thing in the present.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:03.070
It seems to be partly because the amygdala
doesn’t have any sense of time.

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:06.960
it’s interesting because one of the things
Jung observed was that there’s no time in

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.110
the collective unconscious.

01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:11.090
It’s like everything is an eternal now.

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:16.900
So let’s say you got traumatized when you
were a kid, your amygdala grows; maybe you

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.540
got bitten by a spider.

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:22.770
You’re afraid of that spider then and now
and in the future.

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:24.090
It’s the same.

01:15:24.090 --> 01:15:26.420
It’s outside of time.

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:29.390
The hippocampus is the thing that’s dealing
with time.

01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:34.570
So, you know, if you really learn a lesson
it’s supposed to be timeless.

01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:38.790
You can still help people overcome their phobias,
but you can’t get their damn amygdala to

01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:39.920
shrink again.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:43.270
So, you can just get it back under control.

01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:46.790
Okay, so that’s pretty cool.

01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:50.770
Then, we could say, let’s go up a level
or two.

01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:56.660
Well, let’s look at the amygdala for a minute.

01:15:56.660 --> 01:16:00.200
Things about the amygdala have probably changed
since I updated my knowledge, but it doesn’t

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:04.110
really matter because the fundamental systems
I’m telling you about exist.

01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:13.550
They keep moving around in the brain because
we don’t know exactly how they work, but

01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:18.900
at a system level of description and using
slightly vague neuropsychology, we can localize

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:20.570
these sorts of things in the brain.

01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:24.430
Okay so the amygdala gets inputs from everywhere.

01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:30.220
Basically what it’s looking for are things
that might threaten you.

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:37.670
You could say in a sense that the amygdala
has an inbuilt sense of the monstress.

01:16:37.670 --> 01:16:42.630
Let me show you, this is a good time to show
you a comic.

01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:44.770
This is a great comic.

01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:47.360
Someone stoned came up with this comic.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:51.050
They really did.

01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:56.590
I really like this comic because it shows
you what’s going on perfectly.

01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:59.040
Okay, so there are these hippies.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.560
They’re all friends of this guy named Fat
Freddie.

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.430
They’re basically useless hippies.

01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:09.240
They don’t pay rent and all they do is smoke
pot.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:13.820
Anyways, at one point they make a bunch of
money on some cocaine deal and they buy this

01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:16.210
home out in the country.

01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:18.860
They think they’re going to go out there
and live in paradise, so they bring their

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:23.700
cat along, which is Fat Freddie’s cat who
has his own adventures with cockroaches and

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:24.920
so on.

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:29.020
Anyways, if you’ve ever had a cat one thing
you know about cats is they don’t like to

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:30.020
move.

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.020
It makes them very upset and nervous, and
if you put them in a new house they’re not

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.210
happy about it.

01:17:34.210 --> 01:17:37.230
The reason for that is you’ve blown their
map, right?

01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:42.810
The cat will slink around in a new territory
and map every single place and every hiding

01:17:42.810 --> 01:17:47.880
place, obsessively, until it knows what the
hell’s going on, and then it will finally

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:48.880
relax.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:51.040
A cat in a new place is not a calm cat.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:56.460
A cat in a new place is a nervous cat, which
is also an indication that you don’t have

01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:58.480
to learn to be afraid.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.910
What you have to learn is how to be calm.

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:05.300
That reverse the way that psychologists generally
talk about anxiety, because they’re all

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:08.090
hobbits and they think that life is safe.

01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:11.770
So because they think that life is safe, you
have to learn to be afraid.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:13.220
That’s dopey.

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.631
The natural condition is terror and curiosity.

01:18:16.631 --> 01:18:20.350
If you’re really lucky now and then, you’re
somewhere safe enough so that you don’t

01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:21.930
have to be afraid.

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:24.730
That’s tenuous and delicate.

01:18:24.730 --> 01:18:27.170
So what you have to learn is how not to be
afraid.

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:29.090
Not, how to be afraid.

01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:31.820
Anyways, they got the cat.

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:36.260
So he’s in his box and they take him out
of the box and the cat thinks, “so this

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:37.260
is the country.”

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:42.520
So the cat goes really low and starts sniffing,
and that is what animals do when they first

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.590
start exploring.

01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:48.750
Both of those things: they crouch down because
that makes them less visible to predators,

01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:49.750
and they sniff.

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:56.239
The reason they sniff is because most animals
have their whole brains built around their

01:18:56.239 --> 01:19:00.670
sense of smell; unlike us, where most of our
brain is built around vision.

01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:05.780
Anyways, the cat’s slinking around there
and it smells something that it doesn’t

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:06.780
know.

01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:11.050
It thinks, God only knows what this thing
that I don’t know is.

01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:14.700
It would freeze first and then it would hastily
retreat.

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:16.920
So now it’s underneath the porch.

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.350
One hippie says, “where’d the cat disappear
now?”

01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:21.130
The other one says, “under the house.”

01:19:21.130 --> 01:19:26.000
The cat’s down there shaking, which is what
cats do when they’re freaked out like that,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.360
and it’s got it’s little fantasy going.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.520
You’d hide to if you smelled what I did.

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.370
Then it imagines up this monster.

01:19:32.370 --> 01:19:36.900
A monster technically is the amalgamation
of unrelated parts.

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.420
So what’s the monster?

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:44.840
Well its got duck feet and bare arms and its
got a skunk tail and its got kind of a wolf

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.060
head, and its got antlers.

01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:49.160
You think, well that thing doesn’t exist.

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.430
That’s wrong.

01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:51.430
That thing exists.

01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:56.710
In fact it’s a really accurate representation
of what’s out there in the forest.

01:19:56.710 --> 01:20:01.840
Any one animal wouldn’t look like that,
but the set of all possible animals looks

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.050
exactly like that.

01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:08.420
Then you might think, well what do you want
first, when you’re analyzing something?

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:12.220
Do you want quick and dirty representation
of what to be afraid of?

01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:15.860
Or do you want to hang around trying to figure
out whether that thing has hooves and teeth?

01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:21.190
It’s like no, you want a quick and dirty
representation of just what might be lurking

01:20:21.190 --> 01:20:22.430
out there.

01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:24.530
That’s intelligent hypothesizing.

01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:28.030
It’s the kind of hypothesizing that would
be evolutionary driven.

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:33.340
Did you ever see the far side cartoon, Monster
Snorkel?

01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:35.390
I love that cartoon.

01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:40.770
There’s this little kid in his bed, it’s
dark and he’s under cover.

01:20:40.770 --> 01:20:44.350
He’s one of those ugly little kids that
Gary Larson always drew.

01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:51.030
He’s got this snorkel that you use for scuba
diving.

01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:54.450
Snorkeling, not scuba diving.

01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:59.360
All that’s sticking out from under the covers
is his snorkel so that he can breathe.

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:05.940
Of course in his imagination there’s some
reptilian dinosaur sitting beside his bed.

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:07.210
Well, why?

01:21:07.210 --> 01:21:09.750
That’s what he’s hypothesizing.

01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:10.750
Why?

01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:14.000
Because that’s what’s in the dark.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.800
You can tell your kid, there’s no monsters
in the dark.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.989
Then you tell your kid to never talk to a
stranger.

01:21:19.989 --> 01:21:21.870
Well get your story straight people.

01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:22.870
Really?

01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:24.210
It’s so dopey.

01:21:24.210 --> 01:21:27.260
Yes there are monsters in the dark.

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.260
What do you tell your kids?

01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:30.040
No, there’s no such thing as monsters.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:35.210
First of all they’re driven half crazy because
they think what am I afraid of then?

01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:39.380
Second, you tell them all of the time that
there are monsters in the dark.

01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:43.870
In fact you’re probably more paranoid about
the things than your damn kid is.

01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:45.060
So what do you tell them?

01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:49.330
There are monsters in the dark but you can
probably handle them, especially with our

01:21:49.330 --> 01:21:50.330
help.

01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:52.750
Okay, so now I’ll tell you a story.

01:21:52.750 --> 01:22:00.670
So my nephew, he was six, and he had night
terrors.

01:22:00.670 --> 01:22:04.780
Night terrors are this strange phenomena where
all of a sudden you wake up screaming.

01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:07.500
It’s quite unpleasant.

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.600
You might say, well why is this happening?

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:13.770
The answer is that we really don’t know
but there was some instability in his household

01:22:13.770 --> 01:22:14.770
at that point.

01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:18.370
A, he was just going off to kindergarten,
so that’s a big transition.

01:22:18.370 --> 01:22:21.130
It’s out of paradise and out into the world.

01:22:21.130 --> 01:22:27.250
B, his parents were in the throws of approaching
divorce, so there was that sort of undercurrent

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:28.250
in the house.

01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:29.610
You know what that’s like.

01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:32.710
You walk into a house like that and you know
something’s up.

01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:34.440
It’s like the air is frozen.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:37.800
It’s probably something you can smell, I
think.

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:41.510
Whatever, it doesn’t matter, but you can
certainly tell.

01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:44.560
So anyways, he’s waking up at night screaming
away.

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:47.210
He’s a very verbal kid.

01:22:47.210 --> 01:22:51.300
During the day he’s running around, I guess
he was about four, not six.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.530
He’s got this little night hat that he wears.

01:22:53.530 --> 01:22:54.650
It’s a plastic night hat.

01:22:54.650 --> 01:22:58.820
So he zooms around with that all of the time,
and he’s got this plastic sword, and he

01:22:58.820 --> 01:22:59.820
zooms around with that too.

01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:02.090
So you think what’s he up to?

01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:06.541
He’s playing knight, which is kind of weird
in a way.

01:23:06.541 --> 01:23:11.020
Because you’d think why would being a knight
be attractive to a kid?

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.710
We weren’t knights for that long.

01:23:12.710 --> 01:23:14.160
Whatever, it doesn’t really matter.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:17.060
He was running around playing knight.

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:21.400
He goes to sleep and he puts his knight hat
and is sword right beside his bed.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.410
So fine, I watch that.

01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:26.430
I’m watching what’s going on with them
and I’m figuring out what’s going on in

01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:27.430
the house.

01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:29.810
His mom is worried because he’s having night
terrors.

01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:32.450
Yeah, it’s horrible he wakes up screaming.

01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:34.440
So okay, nighttime comes.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:38.920
He wakes up screaming, we’re all sitting
at the breakfast table the next day.

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:42.270
I said, did you dream about anything?

01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:43.340
He said, yeah!

01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:50.570
He got right into this dream and he said okay,
this is what happened: I was out in a field

01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:53.650
and all of these little dwarfs were around
me.

01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:57.310
They only came up to my knees but they had
big beaks, they didn’t have any arms, but

01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:59.400
they had big beaks.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.120
They were covered with hair and grease, so
they were all greased down.

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:06.550
There was a cross-shave at the top of their
head, and wherever I went these beaked dwarfs

01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:10.680
would jump at me with their feet and bite
me.

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.400
They’re everywhere!

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:17.260
Everyone stops eating breakfast to look at
this kid, thinking, wow no wonder why you’re

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:19.380
screaming man.

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:25.010
Then he said, yeah, and it was worse than
that because there was smoke and at the back

01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:29.340
of the dwarfs there was this dragon and the
dragon was breathing out smoke and fire and

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:31.150
the smoke and fire would turn into the dwarfs.

01:24:31.150 --> 01:24:33.830
Oh my God, what do you do about that?

01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:37.910
Wiping out some dwarfs, who cares, but the
dragon will just breathe up some more.

01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:39.900
That’s life man.

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:46.510
I’ve got this excellent picture, let me
show it to you because it’s worth finding,

01:24:46.510 --> 01:25:14.010
even though it’s going to interrupt my story
a little bit.

01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:16.390
Well I’m not going to find it because it
will take too long, but I’ll tell you what

01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:17.390
it is.

01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:19.670
It’s a Greek amphora.

01:25:19.670 --> 01:25:25.350
You know amphora, it’s like a vase, and
people used to keep wine in them.

01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:29.810
It’s painted on like a cartoon, it’s sort
of black and white.

01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:33.630
It’s got this hero, who I believe is Hercules.

01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:37.080
Hercules is facing this snake, and it’s
a really cool snake.

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:40.810
So first of all it’s tail is curled in a
perfect circle.

01:25:40.810 --> 01:25:47.930
If you look at dragons and snakes in mythology,
their tales are often curled in a circle.

01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:51.520
It means something like infinity.

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.570
Then there are all these snakes – it’s
a hydra.

01:25:53.570 --> 01:25:56.040
It’s a snake with eight heads.

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:59.580
Then there’s Hercules with his sword – well,
what’s the problem with the hydra?

01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:04.790
You cut off one head and eight more heads
grow.

01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:12.000
Quit cutting off heads – it’s a good piece
of foreign policy advice for the middle east.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.360
The hydras keep growing.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:16.370
Okay, so cutting off heads isn’t going to
be of any utility.

01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:21.210
Here’s what the story is saying: no matter
how many problems you solve there’s going

01:26:21.210 --> 01:26:24.670
to be a bunch more problems and it’s even
worse than that.

01:26:24.670 --> 01:26:28.489
If you have a problem and you solve it that’s
going to lead to more problems.

01:26:28.489 --> 01:26:30.380
So even the solution is a problem.

01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:32.980
That’s the law of unexpected consequences.

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:36.060
That’s why automobiles have destroyed the
atmosphere.

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:40.770
Everybody thought an automobile is for getting
from point A to point B. It turns out it’s

01:26:40.770 --> 01:26:41.770
not.

01:26:41.770 --> 01:26:45.550
It’s for turning the world’s holes into
jungles.

01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:47.270
We didn’t know that.

01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:50.270
So that’s an unexpected consequence.

01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:54.510
So anyways, the kid is faced with this horrible
conundrum.

01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:55.510
What am I going to do?

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:58.610
I’ve got these stupid dwarfs and then there’s
this dragon.

01:26:58.610 --> 01:27:03.530
So I said, what could you do about that?

01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:07.130
Now that’s called a loaded question and
it would be inadmissible in a court of law

01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:14.580
in a sense because it’s a question – but
it isn’t because I’m telling him something.

01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:18.489
You could do something about that.

01:27:18.489 --> 01:27:19.890
Well that’s a hell of a theory.

01:27:19.890 --> 01:27:23.070
Well yeah, I should just lay down and let
the dwarfs eat me.

01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:25.320
No, no you could do something about it, I
said.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.380
What could you do?

01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:32.920
Then he said, I’d put my hat on, I’d get
my sword, then I’d go get my dad and we’d

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:33.920
go up to the dragon.

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:38.050
I would jump on his head and then I’d poke
both his eyes out with my sword and then I’d

01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:42.320
go right down to his stomach to the place
where the fire comes out and I’d cut a piece

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.640
off of that and I’d use it as a shield.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.050
And I thought, “right on, kid!

01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:49.050
You got it.”

01:27:49.050 --> 01:27:51.780
It was so cool because he had the whole thing,
eh.

01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:53.469
That’s why he was running around playing
knight.

01:27:53.469 --> 01:27:59.210
He’d almost got it, and all I had to do
was drop – there’s this fifth chemical

01:27:59.210 --> 01:28:01.880
phenomena called a super-saturated solution.

01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:02.920
It’s kind of cool.

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:10.270
So if you take - water can only dissolve so
much sugar until the sugar starts to crystallize

01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:14.800
out.

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:22.820
If you really slowly cool down then water
and you don’t tap it there’s no impurities.

01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:27.730
You can get the solution super saturated which
means, weirdly enough, it holds more sugar

01:28:27.730 --> 01:28:29.180
than it can.

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:34.540
It’s like it forgets to crystallize or maybe
it needs a little impurity or shock or something

01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:37.470
to get it going, but it’s like it forgets
to crystallize.

01:28:37.470 --> 01:28:40.167
So then if you take a little crystal of sugar
and you drop it in, it’s like it goes “sound”

01:28:40.167 --> 01:28:44.040
and instantly it’s all crystals.

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:49.300
So that’s what happened to this kid: he
was there, he was ready, he had to answer,

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:54.720
and all I had to do was say you could do something
about this and “poof!”

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:55.790
instant hero myth.

01:28:55.790 --> 01:29:01.870
The cool thing is no more night terrors.

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:05.000
So you get the picture, it’s very, very
cool.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.600
Alright so, back to our discussion.

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:24.460
Now, alright so you’ve got the brain here.

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:37.740
This is the brain as conceptualized by Alexander
Luria, who was Russia’s most famous neuropsychologist.

01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:42.390
So basically he said that there’s a bunch
of different ways you can divide up the brain.

01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:46.660
It depends on what you want, which is an interesting
way of thinking about it.

01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:50.700
Because you might say well how should you
divide up the world and the answer is it depends

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:52.239
on what you want.

01:29:52.239 --> 01:29:57.760
It depends on some degree of the world, but
it depends even more on what you want.

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:02.889
So one of the things Luria said was if you
go from the back to the front of the brain

01:30:02.889 --> 01:30:07.550
– the front’s the grey part here – what
you see is, roughly speaking, the back half

01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:12.700
of the brain does sensory processing, especially
visual processing, and the front half of the

01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:14.410
brain does motor processing.

01:30:14.410 --> 01:30:18.980
Okay, and so if you look at the back of the
brain the sensory unit there, you see there’s

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:21.190
an auditory area and a visual area.

01:30:21.190 --> 01:30:24.730
What’s cool is those overlap to some degree.

01:30:24.730 --> 01:30:29.750
So there’s some hypothesis that the place
where the sensory systems overlap are the

01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:34.930
parts that are responsible for your experience
of a unified perceptual field.

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:39.320
So here’s an example: imagine the visual
cortex and the auditory cortex overlap in

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.320
once place.

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:45.840
Okay, so it would sort of be here, about there
on the left side.

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:48.489
That’s the part you use for silent reading.

01:30:48.489 --> 01:30:50.489
Isn’t that cool?

01:30:50.489 --> 01:30:52.550
It means your using your eyes as ears.

01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:56.390
The way you do that is you use the overlap
between the visual and the auditory cortex.

01:30:56.390 --> 01:31:00.390
It’s so cool, you can use your eyes as ears.

01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:03.440
So the senses aren’t as separate as people
think.

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:07.390
I used to wear glasses and I couldn’t hear
what people were saying when I wasn’t wearing

01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:08.390
them.

01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:10.820
The reason for that is I wasn’t watching
their lips.

01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:14.680
So a lot of what I was hearing in language
processing was the expression on their face

01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:15.980
and the movement of their lips.

01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:18.490
I take off my glasses, and I’m deaf.

01:31:18.490 --> 01:31:21.440
So anyways, that’s the sensory unit, half
of the brain.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.690
Most of it’s the visual cortex because we’re
visual creatures.

01:31:24.690 --> 01:31:26.739
The front half is the motor unit.

01:31:26.739 --> 01:31:27.910
Okay, why?

01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:31.219
Well because we proceed and act.

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:34.230
So it’s the part of the brain that’s responsible
for zipping you around.

01:31:34.230 --> 01:31:36.650
You’ve got voluntary action, right?

01:31:36.650 --> 01:31:43.180
You inhabit a nervous system that enables
you to navigate your way around the world.

01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:44.469
We’re navigators, fundamentally.

01:31:44.469 --> 01:31:48.010
We really are navigators.

01:31:48.010 --> 01:31:51.010
You know ants can navigate by the stars?

01:31:51.010 --> 01:31:52.010
Think about that.

01:31:52.010 --> 01:31:54.530
How the hell can an ant navigate by the stars?

01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:59.590
They figured that out by watching ants figure
out how to get back, and then covering up

01:31:59.590 --> 01:32:03.260
the sky, and then the ants would wander around
not knowing where they were going.

01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:07.070
Yeah there’s lots of things we don’t understand,
I can tell you that.

01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:08.910
So anyways, the motor unit.

01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:11.230
You’ve got the motor strip.

01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:15.810
Now if you touch that with an electrode during
brain surgery then people will either move

01:32:15.810 --> 01:32:20.450
or have the impulse to move and you can map
out how the body is represented in the brain

01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:24.460
by touching that strip with an electrode,
and that was done by Wilmer Penfield at the

01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:25.920
Montreal Neurological Institute.

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:31.250
It was a major move forward in the understanding
of the brain and he did that on epileptics

01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:35.560
before surgery, because he didn’t want to
take out parts of the brain that were necessary

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:37.730
so he was trying to figure out what they were
doing.

01:32:37.730 --> 01:32:42.020
So that’s the part that enables you to act
voluntarily, and in front of that there’s

01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:44.360
the premotor strip.

01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:47.030
In front of that there’s the prefrontal
cortex.

01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:53.710
Now, what’s cool is that the premotor strip
and the prefrontal cortex grew out of the

01:32:53.710 --> 01:32:56.160
motor strip over the course of evolution.

01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:59.610
So then you might say, well why do we think?

01:32:59.610 --> 01:33:03.320
The answer isn’t so that we can come up
with accurate, objective representations of

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.320
the world.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:07.200
The answer is, so that we can plan what to
do.

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:14.460
What you see, fundamentally, is that as you
move forward in the brain you go from action

01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:16.400
to planning action.

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:20.230
So by the time you get to the prefrontal cortex,
let’s say the dorsal-lateral prefrontal

01:33:20.230 --> 01:33:24.810
cortex, which is the part of the brain that
you use for abstract thinking, what you’re

01:33:24.810 --> 01:33:33.780
basically doing is conjuring up avatars of
yourself in an imaginary world, running them

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:38.270
as simulations in your imagination, and the
collective imagination, that’s what stories

01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:42.910
are, running the simulation until the end
to see if you live or die.

01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:45.740
If you die then you don’t implement the
simulation.

01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:49.270
If you live and thrive then you do implement
the situation.

01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:57.200
So – who was it – Carl Popper, philosopher
of science said, the reason we think is so

01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:00.200
we can let our thoughts die instead of us.

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:03.290
Right, that’s smart.

01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:06.640
That also ties into the death and rebirth
idea, right?

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:11.100
Are you going to die, or are you going to
let your avatars die?

01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:17.710
One way of thinking about that is that your
current self is just an avatar.

01:34:17.710 --> 01:34:21.490
Now if you understand that, that means you
also understand the relationship between the

01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:25.210
Jungian self and the ego.

01:34:25.210 --> 01:34:28.580
The ego is an avatar, the self is the thing.

01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:33.600
Now I don’t know if you know this, but the
word avatar is actually a theological term.

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:36.270
It’s from Sand script.

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:39.720
An avatar is the form that a God takes on
earth.

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:43.969
It’s pretty cool that that turned into the
term for the thing you use in a video game.

01:34:43.969 --> 01:34:48.920
That’s your little, disposable self.

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:52.050
You throw it out there in the world and it
can live or die, and you’re back there like

01:34:52.050 --> 01:34:54.880
God just being eternal all along the way.

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.050
So, that’s a very, very weird thing.

01:34:58.050 --> 01:35:01.090
Anyways, even before we had video games we
were doing that.

01:35:01.090 --> 01:35:07.239
We had fiction, we had stories, we had imagination,
and it’s decoupled from our motor systems.

01:35:07.239 --> 01:35:13.780
So we can implement these hypothetical instances
of ourselves before we implement them.

01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:15.500
That’s kind of how we fight Hydras.

01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:18.250
Okay, so you have eight snakes, what do you
do about that?

01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:20.469
You have eight potential selves.

01:35:20.469 --> 01:35:25.050
You multiply potential selves just as fast
as you multiply snakes.

01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:28.840
That’s what evolution does, right?

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:32.530
Let’s say you’ve got a mongoose.

01:35:32.530 --> 01:35:36.640
Mongoose like to eat snakes, they’re really
good at it.

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:37.640
They can eat cobras.

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:38.640
Go Mongoose!

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.890
So you think, well a mongoose gets killed
by a cobra.

01:35:41.890 --> 01:35:45.570
Well that’s not a very good mongoose but
that doesn’t matter because the mongoose

01:35:45.570 --> 01:35:49.670
are generating all sorts of mongoose, and
one of them is going to be able to kill the

01:35:49.670 --> 01:35:50.670
snake.

01:35:50.670 --> 01:35:52.540
That’s all that really matters.

01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:58.190
There’s a very funny mouse that lives in
the desert in Arizona.

01:35:58.190 --> 01:36:01.699
I like this mouse a lot, and it jumps.

01:36:01.699 --> 01:36:04.890
It’s so cool, this mouse, it feeds on scorpions.

01:36:04.890 --> 01:36:07.680
How the hell did it learn to do that?

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:12.400
Anyways, it has to teach its young to eat
scorpions, and its quite immune from scorpion

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.530
venom, which is quite helpful.

01:36:14.530 --> 01:36:19.570
Still it goes out – it’s like you going
out to wrestle a blank crocodile – it’s

01:36:19.570 --> 01:36:22.760
like a scorpion is a big thing compared to
a mouse.

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:25.730
The mouse will hop on to the scorpion and
they have this terrible fight, and finally

01:36:25.730 --> 01:36:27.000
the mouse tears it a part.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.739
Then it brings it back and feeds it to its
mice babies.

01:36:30.739 --> 01:36:33.180
Do you know what it does then?

01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:37.050
It goes outside and howls at the moon like
a wolf.

01:36:37.050 --> 01:36:44.630
It sounds like a mouse so it’s really squeaky,
but if you slow it down, you know, which is

01:36:44.630 --> 01:36:49.700
what you have to do if you want to, for example,
hear mouse vocalizations, because they’re

01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:54.190
often much higher than your threshold for
hearing.

01:36:54.190 --> 01:36:59.250
Blank that, to hear a rat’s laugh when you
tickle them, you have to slow down their vocalizations

01:36:59.250 --> 01:37:04.310
because they laugh at ultrasonic frequencies,
so you have to slow down your vocalizations

01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:06.130
to hear them laugh when you tickle them.

01:37:06.130 --> 01:37:10.830
Anyways, these damn mice go out in the desert
at night, after eating a scorpion, and they

01:37:10.830 --> 01:37:12.640
howl at the moon.

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:15.660
Go mice.

01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:20.949
So anyways, back to the brain here.

01:37:20.949 --> 01:37:24.570
There are all of these terrible monsters being
generated.

01:37:24.570 --> 01:37:29.050
You generate avatars of yourself to cope with
them, and generally used to have to evolve

01:37:29.050 --> 01:37:33.930
to do that, but human beings, being the smart
creatures that we are, generated up an environment

01:37:33.930 --> 01:37:39.340
in the imagination and then populated it with
imaginary representations of ourselves, and

01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:40.880
then tried those out.

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:43.699
Then we implement the ones that we think are
great.

01:37:43.699 --> 01:37:48.110
Then you might think, well we’ve been doing
that for a very, very, very long time.

01:37:48.110 --> 01:37:52.910
then you might think, maybe we’ve figured
out exactly what thing we should implement,

01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:57.670
then we might say well that’s the savior
figures in mythology.

01:37:57.670 --> 01:38:00.280
That’s what they are.

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:02.219
What else would they be?

01:38:02.219 --> 01:38:05.280
People have been trying to figure out what
the hell we are forever.

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:10.840
The fundamental question, what is reality
made of, is not the fundamental question.

01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:15.090
The fundamental question is, how do you act
in the world?

01:38:15.090 --> 01:38:18.510
That’s a whole different way of thinking
about the world, but I think, given that I’m

01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:23.770
a Darwinian, I think it’s the fundamental
question.

01:38:23.770 --> 01:38:29.920
You know, obviously, given what I’ve described
to you so far, you can’t fall in love too

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:33.090
much with your current self.

01:38:33.090 --> 01:38:34.150
What if it’s wrong?

01:38:34.150 --> 01:38:35.850
Then you should let that sucker die.

01:38:35.850 --> 01:38:41.110
Then you might think, well what part of you
is it that doesn’t die when your avatars

01:38:41.110 --> 01:38:42.110
die.

01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:43.750
Well that’s what Jung called the self.

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:46.500
Let’s say you undergo a personality transformation.

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:50.469
There’s the old you, you’re all naïve
and something comes along and just wallops

01:38:50.469 --> 01:38:51.469
you, bang!

01:38:51.469 --> 01:38:52.960
Into the underworld, you fall apart.

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:53.960
Then, bang!

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.860
There’s a new you.

01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:59.180
Maybe a little battle weary, but wiser.

01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:04.690
Then you know that one gets walloped out and
into the underworld and up you come again.

01:39:04.690 --> 01:39:07.949
Fine, what’s constant across all of those
transformations?

01:39:07.949 --> 01:39:11.470
That’s the core element of the person.

01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:14.480
That’s what Jung called the self.

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:21.989
Brilliant, it’s so smart.
