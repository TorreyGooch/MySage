well i don't know if acceptable is the
 

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.150 align:start position:0%
well i don't know if acceptable is the

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
right word it's become part of the
 

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.470 align:start position:0%
right word it's become part of the

00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
structure of marriage itself and so now
 

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.990 align:start position:0%
structure of marriage itself and so now
the<00:10:58.640><c> question</c><00:10:59.040><c> is</c><00:10:59.920><c> okay</c><00:11:00.720><c> what</c><00:11:00.880><c> does</c><00:11:01.040><c> that</c><00:11:01.279><c> mean</c>

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
the question is okay what does that mean
 

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.870 align:start position:0%
the question is okay what does that mean
and<00:11:02.240><c> that</c><00:11:02.560><c> certainly</c><00:11:02.959><c> opens</c><00:11:03.279><c> up</c><00:11:03.440><c> the</c><00:11:03.600><c> question</c>

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
and that certainly opens up the question
 

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.630 align:start position:0%
and that certainly opens up the question
on<00:11:05.120><c> the</c>

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.190 align:start position:0%
guess we know that
in<00:39:28.880><c> that</c><00:39:29.119><c> situation</c><00:39:29.760><c> in</c><00:39:29.839><c> particular</c>

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
in that situation in particular
 

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.910 align:start position:0%
in that situation in particular
a<00:39:31.440><c> variety</c><00:39:32.000><c> of</c><00:39:32.240><c> approaches</c><00:39:33.280><c> might</c><00:39:33.599><c> be</c><00:39:33.760><c> the</c>

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
a variety of approaches might be the
 

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.109 align:start position:0%
a variety of approaches might be the
best

00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
best
 

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:35.829 align:start position:0%
best
so

00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:38.470 align:start position:0%
so
something<00:39:36.240><c> like</c><00:39:36.480><c> that</c><00:39:37.040><c> well</c><00:39:37.520><c> so</c><00:39:37.680><c> i</c><00:39:37.839><c> guess</c><00:39:38.400><c> i</c>

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
something like that well so i guess i
 

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.030 align:start position:0%
something like that well so i guess i
guess<00:39:39.119><c> my</c><00:39:39.520><c> question</c><00:39:39.839><c> for</c><00:39:40.000><c> you</c><00:39:40.240><c> as</c><00:39:40.400><c> i</c><00:39:40.560><c> traverse</c>

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
guess my question for you as i traverse
 

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.589 align:start position:0%
guess my question for you as i traverse
this<00:39:41.359><c> is</c><00:39:41.599><c> so</c><00:39:41.839><c> if</c><00:39:42.079><c> we</c><00:39:42.240><c> acknowledge</c>

00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
this is so if we acknowledge
 

00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:46.310 align:start position:0%
this is so if we acknowledge
that<00:39:44.000><c> that</c><00:39:44.320><c> ideal</c><00:39:44.960><c> situation</c><00:39:45.520><c> and</c><00:39:45.680><c> again</c><00:39:46.160><c> just</c>

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
that that ideal situation and again just
 

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.910 align:start position:0%
that that ideal situation and again just

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
using the word ideal i know that there's
 

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.109 align:start position:0%
using the word ideal i know that there's
a<00:39:48.000><c> certain</c><00:39:48.240><c> set</c><00:39:48.400><c> of</c><00:39:48.480><c> people</c><00:39:48.640><c> that</c><00:39:48.800><c> will</c><00:39:48.880><c> watch</c>

00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
a certain set of people that will watch
 

00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:50.950 align:start position:0%
a certain set of people that will watch
