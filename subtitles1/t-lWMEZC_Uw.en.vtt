00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.630
Jordan thank you so much for giving us some time again. I'm in Sydney. You're in Kentucky. Yes, I am

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.929
I'm there as part of my 12 rules for life tour

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.540
Which is I think expanding to hit about maybe 80 cities something like that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:16.089
Goodness. Well, that was very keen to have a follow-up chat after the conversation that you and I had together when you're in Sydney

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.120
And in particular to frame that for people who might be listening this conversation at that time

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.479
I had not seen you in front of a live audience

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.040
The evening of that conversation after that conversation. I had that opportunity at Chatswood one of the

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.479
seven talks that you gave in Australia put together by Sam McClelland from

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.020
From Melbourne every one of them are sellout

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:49.359
I have to say I don't know whether the biggest issue for me is what I learnt by watching that all the questions that arise

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.890
out of it

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.040
But the first thing I'd say is I was concerned at the time

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.660
That you and I had had a very long conversation that it might be too long for people when we put it on the website

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.869
And you said no John? It won't be young people especially are hungry for content. Put it all up there

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.219
They will listen to it. You're absolutely right young people looking for content

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.569
It's it is absolutely amazing. Yes. Well, I mean some of the big YouTube stars like Joe Rogan

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.959
They're they're constantly putting out three-hour podcasts and people listen to all of them long-haul truckers

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.929
listen to them and guys driving forklifts and and young people and and couples and

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.030
Like there's a massive hunger for real for ready for high-quality educational material

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.930
It shouldn't be underestimated

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.520
and I mean one of the things that seems to be the case with these people on YouTube that are making a

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.809
splash let's say in this alternate media format is that

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.650
they fully they have full respect for the or the intelligence of their audience and they don't pull any punches in terms of content or

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.410
length

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.559
Yeah, well, that's where they come back to that

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.569
but but as I say, you know

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.089
It's just extraordinary I pull up in a fuel station out in a country town near where I live

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.859
And somebody gets out of the car next to me father of about

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.660
35 I suppose he looks at me and he just says straight up before even says hello

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.619
he said I've just been listening to you and Jordan Peterson having a conversation and

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.820
Everywhere I go now. That's what people say. So thank you for the opportunity. You made the comment there though there for every youtube

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.380
Visit they'd be up to 11 podcasts. I think that's what you said

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.190
well

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.729
the podcast market is absolutely exploding and you're actually sitting seeing this start to affect book publishing because

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.589
audio books have become extraordinarily popular and people are discovering that they can use their found time when they're commuting or

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.339
Exercising or walking or doing dishes whatever to engage themselves in high quality. Um

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.779
well high quality educational material books and podcasts and so that's a real revolution it and it really is a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.530
revolution

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.460
So these are the people young people too, you know instead of listening to music

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.050
Which is really something because musics being a predominant cultural force for a very long time

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.889
So it's an it's an amazing technological revolution and I really appreciate it or a conversation by the way

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.250
I think we had a great conversation

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.989
I enjoyed it immensely

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.529
And it seems to me that this is a sort of modern version and and I think this is terrific if I'm understanding it correctly

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.600
Or the old idea where people who have perhaps had another great formal education had access to good quality

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.669
Literature and so forth put together by whether it was penguin or what. Was it every man's book

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.639
So every everyday books whatever they were called even Reader's Digest

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.890
To make that education that learning the classics and so forth available widely

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:47.729
And now this is a modern version of it perhaps and I think what's happening with the mainstream mean?

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.390
that they underestimate the

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.600
Moral quality of their viewers, they underestimate their intelligence. They underestimate their persistence and

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.090
they've also become quite manipulative in their use of editing and and message

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.710
Massaging spin really and the other thing that's really good about these sorts of conversations

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.940
Is that what you see is what you get their bare bones

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.510
They're they're not high-tech while they are and their highest tech in some sense, but not on the production end or the editing end

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.869
So people can trust them and they're genuine conversations. They're not designed to craft the message or anything like that

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:27.988
They're not manipulative and and that's a big deal

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:29.949
YouTube YouTube

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:37.558
Particularly doesn't respond well to manipulation as far as I can tell. Well, I enjoyed that conversation enormously. I've been stunned by the response

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:40.889
It's gone very very widely as you know

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.038
Both on your site and on mine

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:46.678
But to come back to that day

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:52.559
later that day you gave one of the talks of the set one of the seven that you gave in Australia Chatswood and

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:54.869
I was very kindly

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.359
allowed to compare it for you and

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:02.609
One thing that 19 years in public life taught me is to have a bit of a look at your audience and summarize them

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.618
It was a pretty amazing experience. The first thing that happened was that you walked on before you said a word

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:12.268
You've got a standing ovation though that that's something unheard of in this country, but they did

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:15.389
90 minutes talk they gave you another standing ovation

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:21.808
you left came for a few minutes came back on took 30 minutes of questions and

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:27.449
Again, they responded in the same way. Let me just say a couple of things about that audience. I was

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.769
firstly I've got to say pretty heavily impacted as I looked out there and

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:36.868
Recognized that there was an enormous hunger to hear what you had to say

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:42.028
Even though your message was perhaps best described as tough. Love you weren't

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:47.518
Ginger in them up with a soft story. You were really pushing you were really challenging them

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:52.019
The second thing that struck me is that I've said many times since I reckon

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:57.838
50% of the people in that room that night were young Australian men under the age of probably 35

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:03.329
The third thing that struck me was that that was a was a cross section

00:07:03.329 --> 00:07:08.609
I would say many of them were University students, but all university graduates

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.649
But many many were not and the fourth thing that just goes back to something. You said a moment ago

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:18.658
They knew what you were saying and you're a clinical psychologist and a highly educated

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:25.018
Person to suggest that they didn't understand would be very patronizing they got what you're on about. Oh, definitely

00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:26.709
There's there's no doubt about that

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:32.129
I mean there those lectures aren't interesting unless you understand them and there's just no doubt that that's happening

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:34.469
you know, I think one of the most that

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.250
psychologists have made

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.909
Especially the more popular ones over the last three or four decades is to try to convince people that they're okay the way they are

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.590
It's like the self-esteem movement, you know, you should love yourself the way they you are

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.340
You should feel good about yourself the way you are and that's actually not a very optimistic

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:57.060
Message for people because people are generally sensible enough to not be particularly satisfied with the way that they are

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.470
They want to be who they could be

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.510
they want to have something noble to aim at and and and

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.740
So I I make that case very strong that you're you should more

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.230
but aligned and on board with who you can be then with who you are and

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.099
that who you can be isn't a person who has endless rights or

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.300
Or or as the member of a privileged or under privileged group

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:26.159
It should be who you should be should be an individual who's willing to take on full

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.400
responsibility for the for the catastrophe of existence and for the malevolence that's part of it and

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.249
See, I think people are responding to that

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:40.679
first of all because everyone who has any sense knows that life is a tragic business and that everyone is

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:48.749
Susceptible to betrayal and malevolence on their own part and and as a consequence of the actions of others, that's our existential

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:57.030
Predicament and I think people also know in a very deep sense that the antidote to that isn't security or safety

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.559
And it's not envy or bitterness. It's the willingness to

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:08.489
try to work to make the world a better place to start with yourself to take responsibility for yourself and then to take

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.890
responsibility for your family and then to take

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:17.249
responsibility for your community and everyone knows that the people they admire are exactly the people that do that and

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.420
We also all know that that's what gets you out of bed on a rough morning

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.890
It's that you've got something important and vital to do and it's not an easy thing

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.800
It isn't necessarily even something that makes you happy

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:36.749
It's something that's meaningful and necessary to fight back against the tragedy and the malevolence of the world and people know that

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.479
Deeply it's deeply rooted inside their their souls. I would say and a call to that is

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:48.239
very meaningful for people including me, you know, I include myself and my audience like I'm

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:53.850
Lecturing to them precisely. I'm having a conversation with them about how we can step the world

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:54.519
right

00:09:54.519 --> 00:10:00.929
And we are setting it right things are getting better very rapidly around the world and we can really push that forward in the decades

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:06.719
To come if we if we made a conscious effort and so I think this is a very exciting message for people

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.779
One of the things that I'd say about Australians is as I got the world's best bulldust detectors. They

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.300
recognise authentic authenticity

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.959
Very quickly, and if you're not authentic, they won't listen

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.240
So I think in part they are responding if I can pay you a compliment by the fact that you weren't talking about you

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:26.639
You were talking about us

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.730
You were addressing

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:36.810
Where we are all together as human beings and in a way it was as though you were saying

00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:39.509
To get to the good news

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:43.379
You've actually got to go through what might be called the valley of death. You've got to face yourself

00:10:43.449 --> 00:10:47.159
You've got to be realistic about yourself in the world that you live in

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.860
And I saw those put young people

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.599
It was almost as though they were saying we're sick to death of a therapy cup a culture that offers us sort of

00:10:54.939 --> 00:10:57.569
To relieve to everyone there's a there's a dictum

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:03.149
that Carl Jung derived from the great alchemists in the circle in this infinite or and it means

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.019
What you most want will be found where you least want to look?

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:13.109
What you most need will be found where you least want to look and that people know that you know

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.329
everyone knows they are tired of

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.230
naive

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:21.990
Optimism let's say and not optimism because optimism doesn't have to be naive and they know perfectly

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:27.000
well that the way to set themselves right is to take careful stock of themselves and to pay very

00:11:27.189 --> 00:11:33.899
careful attention to the errors that they know they're making and to and to grow up and to mature and to and to

00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:41.459
adopt the responsibilities of a forthright citizen and I think people are sick to death of too much discussion of rights and and

00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:45.479
too much discussion of self-esteem and all that all that all

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:50.069
That discussion that goes along with what everyone owes you it's like

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:57.420
it's just not helpful to people because it isn't your rights that give you meaning in life and

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:05.399
You need a meaning to set against the tragedy and every knows that the way that you find that meaning. It's by adopting responsibility, obviously

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.690
For yourself, you gotta take care of yourself your family

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:15.059
I mean you want to be a good person to your parents. You want to be a good person to your siblings and your children

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.740
Clearly and you have to bear some responsibility for your community

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.060
And if you're really firing on all cylinders, you do all those things at the same time

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:30.419
You know and and I do believe and I tell people I do believe that the world is the tragic and malevolent place in many

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.319
many ways but that the way forward through that is is to

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:41.490
Do everything you can to put yourself on the side of what's good and to aim high and that that's where you get the dignity

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:46.409
That enables you to bear life without becoming corrupt and everyone knows this is true

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.930
Who's gonna argue with that?

00:12:48.939 --> 00:12:53.939
having found yourself and having any of your like and being realistic about yourself and

00:12:54.459 --> 00:12:59.609
Recognizing we were talking about this last time the dividing line between good and evil. It's not between black and white or whatever

00:13:00.339 --> 00:13:02.339
captor and jailer

00:13:04.089 --> 00:13:05.730
Or man and woman

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:12.360
It's somewhere across every human heart having recognized that you can then go on and help build a stronger fairer more just more humane

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:14.470
society rather than

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.720
what seems to be the way people approach it at the moment so

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.639
That somehow rather your society can fix your problems. Yes. Well, that's it

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:28.619
I mean for young people in particular, it's kits are actually a very depressing message for young people to hear that

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:35.310
It's time for them to get involved in political activism because any young person who has any sense knows perfectly

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:41.369
Well, if they're especially if they're 18, they're so 19 years old is they don't know a damn thing, you know

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:46.799
They haven't started a business. They haven't started a family. They don't have a permanent relationship. They're not educated

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.870
They don't have any experience and for someone to come and say well you're in a position to change the world is

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.970
nothing, but a way of

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.750
Disenchanting them with adult wisdom. It's like you're not ready to change the world

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:04.410
You've got a lot to learn but you can learn it and in learning it you'll become much more powerful and much more

00:14:04.689 --> 00:14:10.619
Charismatic and much more articulate and much more wise and sensible and that's the way forward

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.380
to being much more than you are and

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:21.240
young people when you're 18 and you have 60 years of life ahead of you what you want to hear above all else is that

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.000
There's way more of you yet to come

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.570
Because what else has anything with those 60 years

00:14:28.089 --> 00:14:29.170
so

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.399
It's it's a message. It's a harsh message because it says well

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:39.539
You're not everything you could be but it's a deeply optimistic message because it's because the idea is that you could be way more

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.230
Than you are

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:48.120
incomparably more than you are and I do believe that and what's so fun about this is that people keep telling me that people

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.909
Keep telling me that it's true. You know, I have people

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.199
Endless people I got one kid come up to me the other day. It was so fun

00:14:55.510 --> 00:15:00.659
He said a year and a half ago. I had just got out of jail and I was homeless

00:15:01.329 --> 00:15:06.299
And he said I started listening to your lectures and I just I got married this year

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.909
I have a child and I just bought my apartment. It's like wow man. Good work

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.609
You know you did that in a year and a half

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:21.570
And you know, I was in LA the other about a month ago and you know this I was in a rough part of LA

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.550
Downtown LA near the Apollo Theater, and I'd given a talk there my wife and I were walking down the street

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.170
This car pick pulled up and then his kid walked out. He was about 19 or so

00:15:31.209 --> 00:15:37.499
Good-looking Hispanic kid ran over and asked me if I was dr. Peters and I said yes, and he was all excited

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.239
He said he'd been watching my videos for about a year and a half and they really helped him straighten out his life

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.649
He was just smiling away

00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:44.670
He said wait a minute

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:49.349
wait a minute and he ran back to his car and he came back out with his dad and

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.459
His dad was standing there

00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:53.639
you know and they had their arms around each other and

00:15:53.709 --> 00:15:56.518
They were just grinning like mad and the kid said look

00:15:56.519 --> 00:16:01.049
I've really put my relationship together with my father and we're really on board with this together

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:07.440
And they were just like so happy you couldn't believe it and that just happens over and over like it happens. I would say

00:16:08.019 --> 00:16:11.819
four or five times a day in restaurants or in airports or while you've been

00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:16.139
experiencing that to some degree in Australia you said and it's it's so good and

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.339
The mainstream media that's been covering what I've been doing, you know

00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:26.519
they just missed this completely because everything it seems like everything that constitutes news in our society has to be

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:34.689
Political and group oriented this isn't political and it's not group oriented what I'm trying to do as a good clinical

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:40.689
Psychologist and perhaps a good educator and I mean good striving to be good in the moral sense is to help people

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.320
develop as individuals and they are and

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:50.679
it's really working and it's it's a thrill to be on this tour because that's all I hear and

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:58.839
no one talks to me about the political issues or very very rarely and it's all because I also think that the battle against

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.749
Collectivists and let's say the battle against identity politics isn't to be had in the political realm

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:09.789
maybe that's a secondary issue what the way that you that you

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:17.679
fight for the sovereignty of the individual is by getting your act together and and right locally right where you are and

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.609
starting to take advantage of everything that you have in front of you and

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:28.570
And then you do, you know harm our way. All you do is make yourself less bad. Who what's the harm?

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.239
Not that's a good thing to some extent

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:38.470
I think the battle here is almost one of statism or collectivism versus individual liberty who's going to shape who?

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:44.739
So you've got the whole that sort of pushed from the left identity politics victimhood policies

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.819
Approaches and what have you we owe these people? What have you?

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:55.029
So the state has control and shapes individuals and helps them forward on the other hand

00:17:55.190 --> 00:18:00.970
You have the different view that says no the state should be shaped by the people that make up the state, you know

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:05.739
Australia is a sum total of individuals who are Australian and they ought to be

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:10.749
Shaping the public square not having the public square of your local the public sector shaping them

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:18.190
The whole argument is about what what what's the primary unit of analysis? That's everything

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:25.179
What's the primary unit of analysis and in the West the primary unit of the analysis has been the logos and that's something like Devine?

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:32.109
individual consciousness and it's on that ground that we developed our idea of individual sovereignty and citizenship and

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.249
you know, we don't talk about a citizen is someone who adopts the

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:42.069
Responsibilities of an ethical being that's a citizen. We don't talk about that even in schools

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:46.179
Tell people that look the meaning in your life is going to be found

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:50.590
It's gonna be proportionate to the degree that you take responsibility for

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:58.689
Positively shaping your experience and the experience of the people around you and this isn't like be good in some in some week

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.860
Be inoffensive and harmless sense. It's not that at all

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.009
It's like get your spine straight get your aggression

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:12.820
integrated pick a heavy goal like a heavy high goal something you can barely tolerate lifting and

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:20.230
struggle along with it and that's where you'll find yourself respect and and people know that it's it's fun to watch the

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:26.710
Working-class guys respond to this too, you know because they know this most of those guys work like mad, you know

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:31.029
and they know that there's nobility in that and and there is and so

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.490
It's it's well

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:37.990
I'm people also say well that they're happy to come to my lectures or even read the book because

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:42.340
I'm helping them find words to express things that they already knew to be true and

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.620
those things that they know to be true are the

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:50.889
Bedrock axioms of our culture and one of the things we got right in the West was the idea of the sovereign

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:58.329
Responsible individual not the person with rights and certainly not the person with rights granted to them by the state

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:03.249
That's not part of the English common law tradition. You're the locus of Rights

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:07.750
But but only in some sense because you're the locus of ultimate responsibility. I

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:15.009
Guess part of what I've been trying to tell people is that there's no difference between meaning and responsibility

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:21.759
They're the same thing. Yeah. No, I understand what you're saying. Now as I looked at that audience. I thought to myself

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.059
We're doing a lot of talking about the first world war in this country

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:32.680
60 thousand Australians died out of a very small population in that horrendous event and we celebrate their bravery those young

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.780
Anzacs we call them who went off to

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:40.659
Gallipoli and then to the Western Front and we're involved in some of the critical battles of the First World War

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.620
every year

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:49.870
Australians turn out in extraordinary numbers and more and more young Australians turn out to if you like pay tribute to their

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:55.210
Courage and as I looked out across that audience, I thought there's a lot of people here that I'd willingly

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.719
Or I would choose to be with in the trenches

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:04.300
They are essentially people who want to be to use the word. You did just a moment ago

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.850
Noble to the best of their ability

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.930
But they live in a culture somehow that says no that's all nonsense

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.479
that's not where you ought to go and

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:20.800
It seemed to me that they're deeply resenting and deeply keen to reject that approach. Look here's here's what it is

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.950
so there's this idea that

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:30.010
That's pushed very hard in the Universities by the postmodern neo-marxist types and before anybody objects

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:36.219
I know perfectly. Well that technically speaking post-modernism and neo-marxist neo Marxism aren't commensurate

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.459
But it doesn't stop people from from joining them together

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:46.119
Ideologically, but in any case the idea is that the West is fundamentally an oppressive patriarchy

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:52.780
which it isn't it's hardly an oppressive society because every society is partly oppressive and flawed, but

00:21:53.390 --> 00:22:00.189
fundamentally, the West is not an oppressive patriarchy and but if you by that line then the next thing that comes along is that

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.770
Anything you do that?

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:04.160
contributes to that

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.079
Patriarchy is also oppressive and tyrannical and so that's extraordinarily

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.819
demoralizing for people who are trying to make their way in the world because they're trying to

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.859
Hoist their responsibilities up on their shoulders and become competent

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:22.660
Contributing adults and they're criticized to death for being oppressive tyrants

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:30.550
And so there's a conflation of competence with tyranny and you can't do anything to anyone that's more demoralizing that you know than that

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:33.100
Nietzsche said if you want to punish someone punish

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.479
Them for their virtues and so they're tired of that. It's so demoralizing

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:44.469
You know, like it appeals to the part of each man. Let's say and each woman for that matter who wants to avoid responsibility

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:49.630
because you can rationalize it and say well I'm not gonna take responsibility because that just makes me a

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.209
tyrant and an agent of the

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:58.209
Patriarchy, but that's a-- that sort of thing leads people down at toolpath and I've seen that my my friends and in my clinical practice

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:04.359
So instead we say look like our culture has problems every culture does and it needs everyone

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:10.150
Everyone has to be awake so that we don't slip at every level of our social being into some like a blind

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:19.089
authoritarianism, but the way that that happens is by waking up and taking responsibility once again for yourself and your family and

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:23.170
Your community and that that and that's Noble which is a word you never hear

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:29.619
It's like a human being has to be a noble creature to withstand the tragedy of existence without becoming corrupt

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.420
and so and that calls to the best in people and

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.089
Jordan just we should wrap up on that part of it that evening though, but there was one other thing

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.830
When we came to question time, there were four mics in the room. They lined up 20 deeper deets

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:50.769
We got to seven. I think the seventh question was from a lady who asked a very intelligent question about what?

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.009
Parents bring to their children and and in particular

00:23:54.770 --> 00:24:00.339
were there things that mothers brought to their children that women do best and other things that

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:08.289
fathers bring to their children that are best you gave a very rousing answer the issue of fathering and as I say,

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:09.130
There are a lot of men there

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:15.130
I gather that your audiences of the demographics have broadened out now, but that was a very young man centric

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.000
group

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.339
And you hammered the importance as I heard it all fathering

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.989
Well, the the empirical literature on this is absolutely clear

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:31.750
I mean, you know, we have this idea that's being pushed forward that all families are equal. It's like

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:36.789
There's a there's a grain of truth in that in that people who are struggling

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:44.259
Mightily to raise their children properly are worthy of respect whether there are single or in couples

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:49.540
but the empirical literature is absolutely clear that that stable intact for the

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:57.100
families with fathers there produce children who do way better on almost every possible measure and even more than that that

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.410
in communities where

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.520
fathers tend to be at home

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:08.050
What you know as part of the stable family the communities themselves do better even those kids that don't have fathers at home

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:14.650
So the role of the father is unbelievably important and the question is what particular rold as a father plan

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:21.550
I just had a good conversation with Warren Farrell about that and part of no part of my research should indicated that

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.460
men are particularly useful in initiating

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:32.019
Rough-and-tumble play and play with their children in general and Farrell extended that by noting that men could use the opportunity

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:35.439
to play as a reward for delaying gratification

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.250
among their children

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:43.479
That's a really big deal because one of the things you have to do to help people mature is to teach them to delay gratification

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.450
and to sustain attention and it looks like

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:52.029
Men that the pleasure that children get in playing with their fathers

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.630
Rough and tumble play but other forms of play as well

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:03.700
Of primary reward that can be used to help children learn to make the proper sacrifices and regulate their impulses over the long term

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.090
so

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:10.269
So, you know and I think fathers now of course mothers can do this too, but I think fathers

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:17.199
Are because mothers are generally charged with the fundamental care of infants. There's a tension between that and

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.009
encouraging children to step forward out into the world as as

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:26.560
Courageous beings and you know mothers are very very attached to their infants and their infants are very fragile

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.259
it's often hard for them to make the transition from

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.070
primary

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.189
security provider and caregiver to

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:34.960
forthright encourage

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.740
er of adventure and that's certainly something that fathers can do is

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:46.479
It's better to construe life as an adventure rather than as an enterprise that's there to make you feel secure or happy

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:52.269
It's a great adventure and a dangerous one at that because everyone's life is at stake in this adventure

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:56.710
You know, we're unbelievably tough creatures if we if we put ourselves out fully

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:05.199
Okay, now you said something very interesting there and very important in my view you talked about empirical evidence in the relation to the importance

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.680
of fathering

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.210
empirical evidence

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.440
reason

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.440
evidence-based decision-making

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.010
calm

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:17.800
thoughtful deliberation rather than emotion in other words the difference between thinking and

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.559
Feeling seems to me to be incredibly important

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.779
We should follow the facts to where they take us, but we're confronted by it seems to be you mentioned

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:30.820
and you said they're not related but we tie them together there, you know sort of cultural Marxism and

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:35.499
post-modernism it seems to me the cultural Marxist will deliberately distort the truth be

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:41.410
because of their agendas or hide the truth because of their agendas the post modernists are fallen into this trap of

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:46.300
If you like moral relativity, so what's good for you is true for you

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.519
And what's good for me is true for me. Even if they're really painting black as white and white as black

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.450
Isn't that a problem?

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:57.250
It's worse than that in some sense because it's not even what's true for you

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.550
It's true for you. And what's true for me is true for me

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:04.359
It's what it's true for your group is only good for your group

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.420
And what's true for my group is only good for my group

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:14.259
And so that sets us off in in group conflict in a tribal sort of way. You know the the

00:28:14.809 --> 00:28:22.209
the real radical types who are swallowed up by this ideology believe that science itself is nothing but a Eurocentric

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:26.169
Patriarchal construct. I mean they dispense completely with the fact that

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.259
Scientific discovery has given us this incredible

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:36.099
Technological power that's lifted the entire world out of abject poverty in a period of about a hundred and fifty years

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.429
For that for them for some reason that doesn't constitute evidence

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.590
and so when you bring up evidence

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:47.589
There's hand waving because the people who dispute this sort of thing rarely know the details of the literature

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:53.530
They just write it off and say well that whole scientific enterprise that's just part of the way that Eurocentric males

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.170
dominate and destroyed the planet

00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:02.439
It's all power games for these people. There's no there's no reality at the bottom of it outside of the power game

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.510
And so that's a well

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:10.600
That that to me that that that's a that's a viewpoint that leads inevitably to tribal conflict

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.559
That's all that's all that's what it does know. You might be able to help me

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:21.819
I think was George Orwell who made a reference to an idea being so utterly stupid that only a member of the intelligentsia could believe

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:25.059
It no sensible person in the street would accept it for a moment

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.869
There was a bit of there that night I would have thought you actually made a comment

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:36.579
quite a I thought a very astute remark that about something that sound absolutely obvious and then you father finished it by saying you

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:43.510
Would have thought someone in a university somewhere might have noticed now if I'd been an academic at any university in Australia

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:50.760
I would have realized that I needed to wake up to myself because the audience lifted the roof the place with their applause they are

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:55.590
highly skeptical about what is happening now in our educational institutions

00:29:55.750 --> 00:30:01.439
There is no other way to read that audience of a thousand decent Australians

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:07.200
They are very skeptical about the value for money. We're getting now out of our tertiary education sector

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:13.019
Yeah, well, it's the whole education sector to I would say increasingly from kindergarten all the way through University

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:13.590
Yeah

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:17.579
I think that I'm in very in creasing lis embarrassed to be a member of the Academy

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:24.509
Because of that like I was reading this book today by a by a Norwegian called progress. It's a really good book

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.830
I would highly recommend it very straightforward and all it is is a compendium of

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.639
empirical facts about how much better the world has been getting for the last

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:39.120
Hundred and fifty years in just every possible way three hundred thousand people a week are being hooked to the electrical power

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.049
Grid, right we've reduced we've almost eliminated

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:50.700
Starvation throughout the world except for political reasons and starvation was a big problem in places like Sweden and Italy

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.860
Less than a hundred years ago

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.310
Island

00:30:54.310 --> 00:31:01.019
People our people have access to fresh water and the fastest growing economies in the world are in sub-saharan Africa

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.889
We're just making progress progress on every possible front and everything

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:09.690
that people learn in the education system seems to be associated with the idea that

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.629
human beings are a cancerous growth on the

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:19.200
planet that we're going to hell in a handbasket and that we're gonna burn ourselves out in the next 50 years and die and

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:24.419
It'll be our fault too. And you know, it's just not the case. It's simply not the case

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:30.990
I mean we have problems in front of us, but there's a deep anti human ethos that permeates that and you know

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.319
Maybe it's still a hangover from our pessimism from the Cold War

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:41.610
You know because everyone was truly terrified for about five decades that we were gonna put everything to the torch, you know

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:46.379
and maybe we still haven't really recovered from that and it's not surprising because it was brutal, but

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.269
Reading this book on progress just made me think again. How badly were

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.870
Educated because people just don't know how much things are getting better and why?

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.830
Free markets are a huge part of it private property is a huge part of it

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:04.049
And that's all associated with the idea of the sovereign individual. And so this really works

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:10.919
I mean, it's true that Europe got rich first, but that's only being a hundred and most at most one hundred and fifty years

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:17.729
It's not even that long. It's really since about 1895 and Europe first, but man China there's no one starving in China

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.920
There's no one starving in India

00:32:19.929 --> 00:32:21.760
You know Southeast Asia

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.760
has enough food and and

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.780
Sub-saharan Africa is growing like mad

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:31.290
And then that we have these we have these we have our education system that trumpets that you know

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:37.409
we live in a corrupt patriarchy that we should all identify with our tribal groups and that the right way of

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:44.399
Interviewing history is victimizer group against victim group. It's like it's no wonder people are skeptical about it

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:51.150
It's a profoundly anti Western ethos. And the thing is about the West is we got the sovereign individual, right?

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:59.369
It's right and it's the responsibility part. That's right. Not the rights part. I mean the rights traits are necessary. But but only

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:05.370
The rights are there so that you couldn't express your responsibility. That's what that's the whole point

00:33:07.179 --> 00:33:14.039
Okay, well let's come to this issue of our own almost loathing now of our own beliefs and values

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:20.069
here in Australia now, we're having an extraordinary debate going on a very wealthy and

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:25.559
Likable, I knew him well philanthropists called Paul Ramsey who was very active in the health center

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.970
Left a very large amount of money to be made available to set up

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:35.879
An academy for the study of Western civilization and he wanted it to be done in one of our major

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.880
universities now one of our most acclaimed universities

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:47.309
Entered into deep negotiations then the education union got involved and said no. No, this is going to be terrible. It'll be all about European

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:54.689
Ideas of European supremacy so that same university has centers for Islamic studies for Indigenous Studies

00:33:55.660 --> 00:34:01.319
They are not particularly autonomous in the sense that the university or sorry. They're not particularly controlled

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.670
It seems by the university

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:07.379
They do pretty much their own thing, but I know you can't have a center for the study of Western civilization

00:34:07.659 --> 00:34:10.499
It will fill us up with all sorts of racist ideas

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:16.529
Supremacist ideas. This is really worrying if we can't understand our own past

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.019
In fact as a very wise Asian said here the other day

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:24.360
If you wonder them that want to understand Asian cultures understand your your own first

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:30.660
Well, it means to me it's just first of all, you know in some sense

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:34.739
I'm less worried about what's happening with the universities than I was because I think that

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:36.730
They're going to destroy themselves

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:42.840
completely if they continue the way they are and that all that's going to happen is that people will take the genuine value in the

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:48.420
Wisdom of the past and presented in alternative forms, they'll just steal it out from underneath the universities

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:53.909
I would say to the philanthropist if the universities don't want the money then they should set up an institute on their own

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:56.910
That might very well be a good course

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:04.799
You can go directly to the people now, you know, like for now a social example for me if I want a lecture now

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.019
I can lecture on anything I want

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.739
Whenever I want with no bureaucratic restrictions

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:16.289
And I have an audience of people who are only listening because they want to listen

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.260
There that's where the university is

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:24.150
The University is where there's an audience to people who are only listening because they want to be educated

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:27.090
That is the University. The buildings are irrelevant

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.009
Let's let's build on that from I'm it because watching this debate unfold in Australia

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.330
We're listening your academic saying ah, no. No, we've got to preserve our academic integrity

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:39.450
And we've we're here to protect

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:43.140
policies of diversity and inclusiveness

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.640
And all of those sorts of things and somebody tartly pointed out

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.849
Actually, we thought they were there to teach our young people how to think for themselves

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:55.890
Primarily that isn't what they're there for because that's predicated on the idea that there are sovereign

00:35:56.230 --> 00:36:00.150
Individuals and that they can actually think for themselves as individuals

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:07.380
The whole idea here is that you're not an individual. You're the member of a group that's it, and they're serious about this

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:13.049
This isn't a trivial objection. It's a fundamental objection, but I would also say look there's a New Testament

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:19.169
Statement don't cast pearls before swine and you know that usually has to do with words

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:25.110
Right don't waste words of wisdom on those who will not hear but you could also just look at it

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:29.579
literally if you have pearls and you're trying to give them to someone

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:36.070
and they won't take them then go find someone else to give the pearls to if you're trying to give money to a

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:42.459
University to do something great and they won't take it. It's obvious that they don't want to do anything great

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:45.160
So don't give them the money. It's the wrong people

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.940
Ok, well, let's taste this had a little bit more

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:52.629
wisdom, you've mentioned the difference between

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.870
if you like knowledge and

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.610
accumulated cleverness

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.610
and what have you and

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:01.790
wisdom

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:05.499
Surely there's a difference because to go back again to Chatswood

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:09.910
I would say a good chunk of the people there were not university educated

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:14.259
But they were smart and I would say they I'd say more they were wise

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:21.820
They were striving for wisdom. And that's where wisdom is wisdom is in the striving for wisdom and wisdom is building out

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:27.760
Wisdom isn't a collection of facts wisdom is knowledge of how to conduct yourself in the world

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:35.679
So it's a it's an action. It's an existential issue. It's an it's its truth as revealed in action. That's wisdom

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.560
wisdom also understands consequences

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:45.100
Well, it's it's sophisticated in its understanding of consequences because you think well

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:48.219
What are the consequences and the answer is well?

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:54.400
There's the consequences for you now and for you next week and next month and five years from now

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:59.289
So the consequences are you and future you so that's an iterated game

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:05.469
but the consequences are also for your family now and in the future transfer to your community now and in the future and

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:11.380
wisdom is the ability to consider all of those consequences as part of your as

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:18.519
part of what guides your vision and your and your and your operations in the world and that's character and

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:22.360
Then nobility of character is to take all of those things into account

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.030
simultaneously as I watch the debate

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:30.009
I thought to some extent one of the problems you've got here is see as Lewis might have pointed out is pride

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:34.299
Pride getting in the way of people having sufficient humility to recognize

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:41.499
That the nonsense they peddling is simply unconvincing in terms of what you might call the pub test

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.490
What would pass the pub test?

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:48.850
Out there where people have common sense and can see when people are being real and when they're not being real

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:51.250
Well, it's easy to dispense with that

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:56.770
You just develop sufficient contempt for the common person and then you don't have to worry about what they think

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:04.150
You know and then and that's and that's when you confuse being smart with being wise and they're not the same thing

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:06.910
I don't think there's any relationship between them

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:09.549
In fact, I mean intelligence is a great gift

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:14.170
But it can go terribly wrong and it can certainly turn into a kind of intellectual arrogance

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:20.829
that's for sure that blinds you to to your own ignorance and humility is the antidote to that and the

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:28.329
humility the element of humility there that's necessary is to understand that what you don't know is more important than what you know, and

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:34.300
So if you're an ideologue you you dispense with all doubt because you already know everything I was

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:36.670
gonna say I was reminded of that friend I

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:43.119
Chatswood as as you probably gathered it had the big impact on man. It was a powerful reminder to me that

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:49.420
For me, it seems very important to recognize it. There's a sense in which the more you learn the more you realizes

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.059
You don't know very much and there's a lot more to learn

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:53.900
Yeah, well

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.739
You know being with an audience can help with it out, too

00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:02.860
Because if you're if you're talking to an audience, you can check to see if your message is being received, you know

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.920
And you might say well these people just can't understand what I have to say

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.210
It's like well, yeah

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:10.210
They probably can if you if you formulated it carefully

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:14.590
And you actually talk to them individual to individual which is what I try to do in my lectures

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:19.299
Like I'm not talking to the mob. I'm not talking to the group. I never talked to the group when I'm lecturing

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:26.350
I always pick people in the audience and speak right to them and they reflect the audit, you know, they reflect the entire group

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:30.430
But they only reflect it because the group is made up of individuals like them

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.989
So let's just go back to something. You said earlier that ask of me is very interesting

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:38.350
And that is that young people don't want to be involved in political activism

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:41.799
They want to get himself sorted out first many of those young people though

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:47.950
I think want to behave nobly and help build a better society a stronger civic square if I can put it that way and

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.890
Good on them. That's terrific. That's important

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:55.480
They're very disillusioned with politics and yet we have to govern our country

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.980
We have to make certain the rules are set if you like

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:03.559
And that we maximize everybody's opportunities to live in freedom and insecurity

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:10.880
When young people have if you like grounded themselves and feel ready to act nobly in the public square

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:16.549
What should they do? How can they make a difference they want to make a difference? How do they go about it Oh

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:19.700
More power to them I think but I think you know

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:26.659
They they start by realizing they don't know anything and by starting to learn and then if they learn and work and discipline themselves

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:31.609
The opportunities to expand will come naturally because people will notice them

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:37.369
Like look if you work with competent people hyper competent people one of the things you learn is that hyper competent

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.130
People are always looking for young people to mentor

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:41.100
Yeah

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.780
there's starving and

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:48.830
Hoping that someone will come along who who has a lot of potential and then what they'll do is offer them an opportunity

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:55.609
Hmm, you know, I keep my eye out at the University and in my private work as well all the time for young people

00:41:55.610 --> 00:42:00.620
Who've got something to contribute. Oh, you look like you're sharp. Let's find out. Here's a task

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:05.599
Why don't you go try this then they come back and knock it out of the park. And you think oh, that's good

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.789
Cuz I got 20 more things here that need doing that

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:12.259
I can't do I've got more opportunities than I know what to do with here's another one

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:19.880
and so the thing is is that if you develop your competence and you discipline yourself and you start to make that manifest in any

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:25.819
Hierarchy that's even vaguely competent. You'll have more opportunities come your way. Then you'll know what to do with

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:28.550
So it'll happen organically

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.209
so and it it is the way of the world and

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.080
well

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.289
if that isn't happening in the organization that you're working with and you're

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.309
Working diligently and you have your art together, then it's time to find a different organization

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:45.349
But generally speaking most organizations aren't that corrupt? Some are

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.380
interesting, I'd say that

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.899
Australia's, have we worship youth culture in a way?

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:54.529
but well things I've noticed about youth is that

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:03.410
Overwhelmingly if I have the opportunity to tap into the wisdom of an older person to be mentored they they go looking for it

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:05.340
They're very keen for it

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.579
Well, it's part of the part of the human

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:13.099
Proclivity to admire and imitate, you know, I mean one of the things that drives us forward

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:13.780
We don't only learn by facts. In fact, we hardly learn by facts at all. We learn by

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:20.400
Stories and we learn by imitation and we and may imitate those we admire and we admire those who are competent

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:26.700
and

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:30.290
So if you find someone who knows what you don't and can operate effectively

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:36.169
in the world in a manner that you would like to but can't then you're going to admire them and if you admire them you're

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:43.700
Going to open the door to have them mentor you and I mean that's that's really fundamental to human cognition and human psychological

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:49.370
Development it's the catalyst for human development because we're deeply imitative

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:52.609
It's it's the thing that distinguishes us from other creatures

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:55.789
Perhaps even more than even more fundamentally than language use

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.840
if I watch if you know how to do something and I watch you do it I

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:04.790
Can learn to do it without having to go through all the pain that you had to go through to learn it

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:06.830
It's such a gift

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:09.560
That's why history is so important our personal history

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:12.830
Our if you like our family history

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:18.679
I was thinking the other day that my grandfather made a mistake with my father on the farm that I am determined

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:22.969
Because I can learn from that not to repeat with my own son on the farm

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.779
And then there's of course the broader cultural history

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:32.329
which is why I believe and I think you win it you and I share this view we ought to learn from our history we

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:34.330
ought to learn from the horrors of

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.489
Collectivism in Soviet Russia, we ought to be honest about it

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:43.550
We should teach our young people at the same time as we're honest about the what's in our own cultural history

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:45.709
But we're also honest about the nobility

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:52.220
For example the mighty push to abolish slavery surely the greatest human rights movement of all times. We ought to know about it

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:57.409
It's Noble. It was led by noble people who struggled against extraordinary odds for a long time

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:03.770
Yes, exactly and slavery was a human Universal. So it's an it's an amazing miraculous attainment

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:11.330
It's it's a miraculous attainment. Absolutely and you know, what we're supposed to be doing in the Universities is separating the wheat from the chaff

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:12.990
not

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:17.990
dispensing with everything as if it's chaff because we don't want to put in the effort to discriminate and

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.989
So it's easier. Well, it's just all corrupt

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.620
It's like no

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.349
it's not people aren't starving to death any more and

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:30.229
societies are increasingly free and children are dying in the massive numbers that they once died in and

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:32.899
People are people's life expectancy has doubled

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:35.270
Like things are going pretty well

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:36.869
don't muck it up and

00:45:36.869 --> 00:45:42.079
We need to figure out why and we need to take stock of the things that we did in the past that were wrong

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:46.880
Obviously, but that doesn't mean that everything everyone did in the past was wrong

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:55.549
That's that that's not thinking that's just that's just reflexive resentment masquerading as intellectual superiority

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:58.940
There's nothing about it. That's good

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:03.049
When you've been incredibly generous with your time, can we wrap up? Let's just think through

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:07.669
What would we say in terms of people looking for solutions in?

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:14.360
Academia in the media in politics. How do we if you like

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:17.060
Start the movement to reclaim

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:19.170
What you called?

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:26.990
evidence based empirical decision evidence in decision-making in other words learn to think again and stop being us so

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:32.000
so emotional there's a place for emotion, but there's a place for thinking I

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.670
Think well, I mean if you're a university student

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:39.409
the first thing you want to note is that you're there to learn to think and to write and to

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:45.950
Read and to speak that's what you're there to do. And the reason you're there to do that is because that makes you incredibly

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.850
confident

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:51.859
Because you're going to have to communicate with people for the rest of your life

00:46:51.859 --> 00:46:54.199
And if your communication has depth and clarity

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:58.999
Then you can see your way forward and you can bring other people aboard and you can do great things

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.519
And so it's super it's super

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:05.809
useful to get a real liberal arts education

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:10.189
because it can make you into a great communicator and thinker if

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:14.510
You're going to university read the great books and you can you can find

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:17.060
Professors who will teach you that but that's what you're there to do

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.660
You're there to spend four years

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:24.920
immersing yourself in the imitation of the greatest people that our culture has produced and if you think well

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:29.420
There were no great people. Well, then you might as well not go to university because

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:36.169
University is the storehouse of the thoughts of great people and if you dispense with a whole notion notion of great then

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:43.399
Maybe you're there too. I'm a political activist, but that's not university. That's something else that's like an ideological cult and

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:46.850
Maybe that's what you want. And and and I mean

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.540
You know, you'll pay the price for that one way or the other

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:57.919
But you even there's a university student you have to take on the burden of educating yourself to large degree

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:03.980
But you have to decide that that's what you want. And that's what you need in terms of your own personal life

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:08.750
Um, I have a program that I developed with my colleagues called the Future authoring program

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:14.659
It's itself authoring calm and it helps people develop a vision for their life

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:19.880
along about six fundamental dimensions family education

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.850
mental and physical health career

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.570
avoidance of temptation like drug and alcohol use

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:32.780
We tried to parse out our use of time you productive and meaningful use of time outside of work

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:36.110
we tried to parameterize a decent life and

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:41.090
Then to guide people through the process of imagining what their life could be like if they put it together

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:46.849
properly and you need to develop a vision for your life and a sense of who you could be if you were the character that

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:48.840
you could be and and

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:54.049
Thinking through that and articulating it is they're actually part of it should be part of a classic liberal arts education

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:58.610
Because the whole point of Education apart from the technical end

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:05.599
Which is important is to produce a noble citizen. That's the point not to produce a bloody political activist

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.530
Well, then you just wish would keep in mind that cuz

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.380
even a Chatswood that not a

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:15.560
Lot of those people. Most of them are not at university

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:21.439
So they're not excluded either from in any way shape or form from broadening their horizon

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:26.629
It's not like they're not doing important things like working men for example working people in general

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:31.010
I don't care what they're doing if they're working at a diner as a waiter. They're there

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:36.439
They're laying bricks or what working a forklift or they're plumbers or these people are bloody important

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.280
they build the infrastructure and there's a huge difference between a a

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:44.089
craftsman who takes pride and caring what he's doing and

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:51.359
Contributes to his family and the community in that nobility of work and someone who does shot in half hazard job

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:53.909
There's great nobility in genuine work

00:49:54.609 --> 00:50:02.069
So and and I believe that you have just as much power. Let's say much as much authority as much clout as a

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:08.489
forthright and honest working person as you do as an intellectual and I mean you can be very

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:11.220
successful as a working person if you if you're

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:15.270
Diligent and honest and committed and competent and aiming up

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:19.469
because it look I do believe that each person is the center of the world and

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:23.190
You have what you need right at that Center and maybe you're not

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:28.530
Intellectual, but you're good with your hands and you're practical and solid and people can rely on you

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:29.440
It's like man

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.690
That's a big deal because then when their roof blows off in the middle of a storm

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:39.959
They can call you up and you're there in an hour and you put the damn thing back together and and and hooray for you

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:47.369
It's a all of these things are important. And so there's great nobility in working class work as far as I'm concerned

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:53.369
Well Jordan that's again a fascinating conversation from my perspective and

00:50:54.100 --> 00:51:00.479
It's tremendous to be able to interact with somebody who cares passionately because that's what that's what they're picking up

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.690
I know it's not about you

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:05.429
You're actually trying to make a difference for people and you know, we're seeing this

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:11.190
I'm really disturbed by the way in which some of these movements were seeing at the moment of trying to divide men from women and

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:16.679
A lot of people getting men are getting this idea that somehow their masculinity is toxic

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.960
Well, you know

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:26.310
We don't say that when the brave young French policeman takes a bullet for a young woman and her daughter in a French supermarket

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:30.719
We celebrate that and I actually think that not all

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:36.479
But the great majority of men want to be Noble they know their flaws

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.740
As you said they've got to be honest about them. We all need to be honest

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:45.509
But they also have a big part of them if you like that divine spike

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:50.489
So does aspire divine spark that leads them to want to be

00:51:50.489 --> 00:51:51.280
 

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.280
responsible noble people

00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:53.850
Yes

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:56.009
And that's that's what women want for men too

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.070
so unless and as they've been damaged in their

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:04.980
Relationship so that they don't trust men at all and then are prepared to dispense with all of them which isn't helpful

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:11.580
But, you know men and women need to call to the nobility in each other and that is what they both want because you want

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.830
a stalwart companion by your side

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:19.529
know if you're a man you want someone you can trust and you can rely on it who will help guide you and and

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:25.409
and and care for you and to care for your children and all of that and to make a life with and if you're a

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:28.469
Woman you want a man that you can rely on and that's going to help you

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:34.889
Help you deal with the children and with the excess fragility that you have because of your pronounced role in reproduction

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:40.840
and that is what we want and to denigrate and to split men and women apart is is to

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:49.360
Damage humanity itself because it's not like we're all men are all women. I have sisters and a mother and a wife

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:49.810
and a daughter and

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:54.120
Women have husbands and sons and fathers. We're not separate and

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:58.829
to split us apart on on the basis of sex it's, it's well. It's

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:06.029
It's it's as pathological as a suicidal impulse or a murderous impulse or a genocidal impulse

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:07.530
none of that's good

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:08.640
It's not acceptable

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:13.379
But we're a hell of a lot better off than we were and things are getting better and we can do better yet

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:15.570
That's a way better story

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:19.140
We look forward very much to having you back on those shores

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:23.669
Very nice speaking with you again, and thank you very much for the opportunity. Thanks Jordan

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:31.630
