the brain okay you said there were 12 I
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.029 align:start position:0%
the brain okay you said there were 12 I
think<00:00:50.640><c> we</c><00:00:50.760><c> should</c><00:00:51.120><c> can</c><00:00:51.239><c> we</c><00:00:51.399><c> go</c><00:00:51.559><c> through</c><00:00:51.760><c> all</c><00:00:51.879><c> of</c>

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 align:start position:0%
think we should can we go through all of
 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.630 align:start position:0%
think we should can we go through all of
them<00:00:52.359><c> we</c><00:00:52.440><c> can</c><00:00:52.600><c> go</c><00:00:52.800><c> through</c><00:00:53.399><c> yeah</c><00:00:53.719><c> I</c><00:00:53.800><c> mean</c><00:00:54.399><c> so</c>

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
them we can go through yeah I mean so
 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.709 align:start position:0%
them we can go through yeah I mean so
those<00:00:54.760><c> are</c><00:00:54.920><c> the</c><00:00:55.079><c> those</c><00:00:55.199><c> are</c><00:00:55.320><c> the</c><00:00:55.399><c> ones</c><00:00:55.520><c> that</c><00:00:55.640><c> I</c>

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 align:start position:0%
those are the those are the ones that I
 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.750 align:start position:0%
those are the those are the ones that I
think<00:00:55.879><c> that</c><00:00:55.960><c> are</c><00:00:56.160><c> Mo</c><00:00:56.680><c> that</c><00:00:56.760><c> are</c><00:00:57.199><c> most</c><00:00:58.199><c> relevant</c>

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
think that are Mo that are most relevant
 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.430 align:start position:0%
think that are Mo that are most relevant
to<00:00:59.480><c> diet</c>

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
to diet
 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.790 align:start position:0%
to diet
but<00:01:00.559><c> I</c><00:01:00.640><c> think</c><00:01:00.760><c> it's</c><00:01:01.000><c> important</c><00:01:01.760><c> at</c><00:01:02.160><c> at</c><00:01:02.399><c> this</c>

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important at at this
 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.630 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important at at this
you<00:01:02.920><c> know</c><00:01:03.359><c> juncture</c>

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
you know juncture
 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.190 align:start position:0%
you know juncture
to<00:01:05.640><c> state</c><00:01:05.960><c> that</c><00:01:06.159><c> diet</c><00:01:06.400><c> is</c><00:01:06.560><c> not</c><00:01:06.720><c> the</c><00:01:06.840><c> only</c>

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
to state that diet is not the only
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.190 align:start position:0%
to state that diet is not the only
nutrition<00:01:07.600><c> is</c><00:01:07.720><c> not</c><00:01:07.880><c> the</c><00:01:08.080><c> only</c><00:01:08.400><c> variable</c><00:01:08.880><c> here</c>

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
nutrition is not the only variable here
 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.910 align:start position:0%
nutrition is not the only variable here
so<00:01:09.600><c> I'll</c><00:01:09.799><c> never</c><00:01:10.000><c> know</c><00:01:10.320><c> what</c><00:01:10.560><c> caused</c><00:01:10.920><c> my</c><00:01:11.080><c> mom's</c>
