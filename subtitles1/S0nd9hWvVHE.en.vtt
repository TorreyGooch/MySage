00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
and so right away that gives you a a
 

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.710 align:start position:0%
and so right away that gives you a a

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.670 align:start position:0%
momentum and an opportunity for Action
that<00:14:04.880><c> maybe</c><00:14:05.120><c> you</c><00:14:05.279><c> did</c><00:14:05.440><c> not</c><00:14:05.800><c> know</c><00:14:06.040><c> was</c><00:14:06.279><c> possible</c>

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
that maybe you did not know was possible
 

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.069 align:start position:0%
that maybe you did not know was possible
before<00:14:07.600><c> uh</c><00:14:07.720><c> so</c><00:14:07.920><c> I</c><00:14:08.000><c> think</c><00:14:08.160><c> that's</c><00:14:08.279><c> an</c><00:14:08.480><c> addition</c>

00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
before uh so I think that's an addition
 

00:14:09.079 --> 00:14:10.230 align:start position:0%
before uh so I think that's an addition
additional<00:14:09.480><c> the</c><00:14:09.600><c> individual</c><00:14:10.000><c> and</c><00:14:10.120><c> the</c>

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
additional the individual and the
 

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.870 align:start position:0%
additional the individual and the
population<00:14:10.639><c> are</c><00:14:10.800><c> not</c><00:14:11.040><c> the</c><00:14:11.160><c> same</c><00:14:11.720><c> oh</c>

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
population are not the same oh
 

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.509 align:start position:0%
population are not the same oh
absolutely<00:14:12.720><c> and</c><00:14:13.279><c> um</c><00:14:13.480><c> I</c><00:14:13.560><c> think</c><00:14:13.920><c> comedy</c>

00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
absolutely and um I think comedy
 

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:16.790 align:start position:0%
absolutely and um I think comedy
potentially<00:14:15.199><c> activates</c><00:14:15.720><c> both</c><00:14:16.279><c> yeah</c><00:14:16.399><c> it's</c><00:14:16.600><c> the</c>

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
potentially activates both yeah it's the
 

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.509 align:start position:0%
potentially activates both yeah it's the

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
power it's the power of the room or the
 

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:21.230 align:start position:0%
power it's the power of the room or the
