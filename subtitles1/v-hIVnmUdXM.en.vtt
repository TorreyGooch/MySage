00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:07.880
I've really been trying to understand the underlying psychology of postmodernism and its relationship with neo-Marxism,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.160
and then the spread of that into the universities and the effect on the culture.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.740
And what I would like to start with is a description of your understanding of that,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.980
because I've presented to the people who are listening to me my understanding of it.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.360
But I interviewed Stephen Hicks recently, and he wrote an interesting book called "Explaining Postmodernism," which I liked quite a bit.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.620
It's been criticized for being too right-wing, although I don't think he's right-wing at all.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.940
I think maybe you could characterize him as middle-of-the-road conservative, but I would say he's more like a classic liberal.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.460
But I'm really curious about your views about, well, what— what Postmodernism is first of all.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.240
I know you've— you've identified it with the— with the general tricksters Derrida and Lacan and Foucault.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.480
And Foucault in particular you've talked about.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.020
But I'd like to know what you think about postmodernism and also why you think it's been so attractive to people.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:10.140
Well, my explanation is that there is no authentic 1960s point of view in any of the elite universities,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.620
but rather the most liberated minds of my generation of 1960 did not go on to graduate school.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.180
I witnessed this with my own eyes.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.200
I saw genuine Marxists, okay, at my college, which was the State University of New York at Binghamton, upstate New York, Harpur College,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.820
which had a huge cohort of very radical downstate New York Jews, okay, who—

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.100
In fact, Harpur used to be called Berkeley East.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.920
I saw genuine passionate Marxists with my own eyes.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.620
They were not word choppers.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.520
They were not snide postmodernists, right?

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.540
They were in-your-face aggressive.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.640
They used the language of the people.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.220
They had a populist and energy, okay?

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.092
They dressed working class. They were nonmaterialistic, okay?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.920
These are people who lived by their own convictions.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.720
They were against the graduate schools, all right?

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.860
When I— When I, uh, went on to graduate school, and it became known that I was going to go to Yale,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.800
I was confronted by a leader of the radicals on campus, in broad daylight in front of everyone,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.520
who denounced me for— he said,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.560
"Grad school is not where it's happening. You don't— You don't do that.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.300
If you have to go to graduate school you should go to Buffalo."

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.580
Now, I had applied to SUNY Buffalo, because the great leftist critic Leslie Fiedler was there, who had a huge impact on me.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.680
He's practically created identity politics, but without its present distortions, all right?

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.400
And Norman Holland, the psychoanalytic critic was there.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.760
I would have been very happy to have gone on to Buffalo, but I needed the library at Yale, so I continued on to Yale.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.180
There were no radicals in the graduate schools, okay, from 1968 to '72, when i was there.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.340
Only one radical, Todd Gitlin, who went on to have a career success, okay?

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.920
The actual radicals of the 1960s, okay, either went off— dropped out of college, or went off to create communes, right,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.800
or they were taking acid and destroyed their brains.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.700
Now, I have also written about that,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.140
the destruction of the minds, okay, of the most talented members of my generation through LSD.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.440
It was going on all around me, right?

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.500
So, what's happened is the actual legacy of the '60s got truncated.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:29.180
The idea that these post-structuralists and postmodernists are heirs of the 1960s revolution is an absolute crock, okay?

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.660
What they represent, as Foucault shows—

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.560
Foucault said, okay, that the biggest influence on his thinking, okay, was Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot," okay,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.260
which was a post-World-War-II play, written in Paris,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:51.240
that was about the disillusionment and nihilism experienced after Hitler went through, occupied France, right, and all of Europe was in ruins.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.060
It had nothing to do with what—

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.300
"Waiting for Godot" has nothing to do with the authentic legacy of the 1960s,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.780
which was about genuine multiculturalism, a movement toward India, toward Hinduism,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:11.500
a transformation of consciousness through psychedelics, which I did not take, but which I identify with totally through the music, etc., all right?

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.720
It was a turn toward the body.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.313
It was a turn towards sensory experience, okay?

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.160
Not this "word-chopping" thing, and this, like, cynical removal from actual experience, all right?

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.140
That French import, okay, came in, okay, to the graduate schools.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.200
It did not affect any genuine 1960s person.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.580
The real 1960s revolution was about Jung.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.200
It was about a way of seeing the cosmos in mythological terms, all right?

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:45.520
And the Jungian contribution went on into the New Age movement of the 1970s, aside from the universities, all right?

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.700
So, who took over the universities were these careerists, okay?

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.200
I saw them with my own eyes. I saw what happened. I saw—

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:01.120
I was at Yale when Derrida was being shipped over, okay, to address the, uh, you know, the students— the grad students and the faculty.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.300
And I said to a fellow student, after hearing one of these guys speak—

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.500
It wasn't Derrida. It was another one of the theorists.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.120
I said, "They are like high priests murmuring to each other." All right?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.940
This was an elitist form from the start, okay?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.200
It was not progressive. It was not revolutionary. It was reactionary.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.380
It was a desperate attempt to hold on to what had happened before the 1960s sensory revolution.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.000
But this postmodernist thing, okay, this trashing, okay, of the text,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.600
this— this encouragement, okay, of a superior and destructive attitude toward the work of art—

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:49.520
We're going through it, okay, primly, with red pen in hand, finding all the evidence of sexism, check, racism, check, homophobia, check.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:57.660
That is not the empathic, emotional, okay, sensory-based, okay, revolution of the 1960s, right?

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.740
I am sick and tired of these people claiming any kind of mantle from the 1960s. They're frauds.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.940
These people are— What happened in the 1970s was a collapse of the job market in academia, okay?

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:16.920
All of a sudden, jobs were scarce, and this thing was there, the new and improved and shiny thing, okay, to be a theorist.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.140
And people seized on it, okay? It was institutionalized, all right?

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.400
And it's an enormous betrayal of the 1960s.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.900
Okay so that- You touched on this idea of "the destruction of the work of art".

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.400
You know, and one of the things I really liked about reading Nietzsche was his discussion of "ressentiment" right?

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.200
-of resentment and it seems to me that tremendous amount of the motive power

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.400
that drives the postmodernist- let's call It- it's not a revolution, uh-

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.109
transformation seems to me to be driven by resentment about virtually anything that has any,

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:54.429
well, what would you say... any merit of competence or aesthetic quality,

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.870
and I don't know if that's- It seems to me that that's partly rooted in the

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.000
academic's disdain for the business world, which I think is driven by their relative economic inequality,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.300
because most people who are as intelligent as academics are,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.570
from a pure IQ point of view, make more money in the private sphere, and so I think that drives some of it.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:20.200
But there also seems to be this- There's a destruction, an aim for destruction of the  aesthetic quality of

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:28.600
the literary or artistic work, its reduction to nothing but some kind of power game, and then surrounding that,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.500
the reduction of *everything* to something that approximates a power game, which I can't help but

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.500
identifying with jealousy and resentment as a fundamental motivator.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.300
Does that seem reasonable to you?

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:45.579
These professors who allege that art is nothing but an ideological movement by one elite,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.900
against the- against another group, these people are Philistines, okay?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.900
They're Philistines. They're Middlebrow, hopelessly Middlebrow.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.200
They have no sense of beauty. They have no sense of the aesthetic.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:09.500
Now, Marxism does indeed assert this, but Marxism tries to reconfigure the universe in terms of materialism.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.500
It sees- It does not recognize any kind of spiritual dimension.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.700
Now, I'm an atheist, but i see the great world religions as enormous works of art,

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.700
as the best way to understand the universe and a man's place in there.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:29.900
I find them enormously moving. They're like enormous poems, right?

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:35.700
And what I have called for, the true revolution, okay, would have been to make the core curriculum

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.800
of the world education, the *world*, okay, the great religions of the world.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I feel that is the only way to achieve an understanding, and it's also a way to present the aesthetic,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:55.000
because i feel that that that the real sixties vision was about exultation, elevation, cosmic consciousness, okay?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.500
All of these things were rejected by these midgets, okay, intellectual midgets

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:09.000
who seized onto Lacan, Derrida and Foucault. It's a- my career has been in the art school, my entire career,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.200
beginning at Bennington college. So I represent a challenge to this from the perspective of Art.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:22.700
It is an absolute nonsense, okay, as post-Structuralism maintains, that reality is mediated by language, by words.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.200
Everything that we can know, including gender.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:32.500
It is absolutely madness, because I'm teaching students whose majors are ceramics, ok, or dance,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:39.300
or who are jazz musicians, who understand reality in terms of the body, its sensory activation.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.070
So they- See, what happened was something was going on in the art world as well.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:48.439
I identify With Andy Warhol in pop art, okay? That was what was going on during my years in college.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.500
Everything about Andy Warhol was like, "Wow! Admiration! Wow!"

00:09:53.500 --> 00:10:01.900
What happened immediately after that in the arts, 1970's okay, was this collapse into a snide sort of post-Modernism also.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:08.200
This happened in the art world, and it was an utter misunderstanding of culture, it seems to me,

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:15.000
by that movement in the art World. That Is, oppositional art, in my view, is dead, okay?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.200
-and what post-Modernism is, is a pathetic attempt to continue the old heroism of the Avant-garde.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.300
The Avant-garde was genuinely heroic from the early 19th Century, okay?

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.600
We're talking about, you know, the corbeil, the realists, you know?

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.400
We're talking about Monet and the Impressionists,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.000
people who have genuinely suffered for their radical ideas,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.700
and their innovations and so on, going right down to Picasso, and down to Jackson Pollock,

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.700
who like was- who truly suffered for, you know, for his art.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.800
It was only after his death, okay, that suddenly the market was created for abstract art.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.800
Pop art killed The Avant-garde.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.200
The idea that the Avant-garde continues is an absolute delusion of the contemporary art world,

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:03.000
which feels that it must attack, attack, attack- challenge, okay, the simplistic beliefs of the hoi polloi, okay?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.340
It's somehow the order- What? Excuse me, okay?

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:11.000
From The Moment, okay, Andy Warhol went through and embraced the popular media,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.300
instead of having the opposition to it that serious artists have had, that was the end of Oppositional art, okay?

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:22.700
So, we've been going on now for 50 years: the post-modernism and academes hand-in-hand

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:29.000
with the stupidity and infantilism that masquerades as, you know, as important art galleries everywhere,

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.500
this incredible, incredible, you know, its mechanism of contemporary art,

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.809
pushing things that are so hopelessly derivative,

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.179
and with this idea that, once again, that the art world somehow superior view of reality,

00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:45.300
Authentic Leftism Is populist, okay?

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.600
It is based in working-class style, working-class language, working-class direct emotion,

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.300
in an openness and brusqueness of speech, okay?

00:11:53.500 --> 00:12:00.000
-not this fancy, contorted jargon of the pseudo-leftist of academe, who are frauds.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
These people who manage to rise to the top at Berkeley, at Harvard, At Princeton, okay?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.700
How many of these people are radical?

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:12.000
They are career people. They're corporate types, okay, who succeeded in-

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
They *love* the institutional context. They know how to manipulate the bureaucracy,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.300
which has totally invaded and usurped academe everywhere, okay?

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.800
These people are company-players.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.000
They could have done well in any field, okay? They love to sit on endless committees.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.500
They love bureaucratic regulation, and so on. There's not-

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:39.200
Not one *Leftist* in American academia raised his or her voice against obscene growth of tuition costs,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.000
which have bankrupted a whole generation of young people.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.300
Not one voice to challenge that invasion by the bureaucrats, okay, absolute fascist bureaucrats, okay,

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.800
with- who had a- They're like, uh,  cancerous, okay?

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:58.000
There's so many of them, the faculty have completely lost any power in American Academia, okay?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
It's a scandal what has happened. I mean-

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.500
And they deserve the present servitude that they're in right now, because they never protested, okay?

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:10.469
When I- My first job at Bennington college, 1976 I was there, when there was an uprising by the faculty

00:13:10.469 --> 00:13:16.480
against encroachment by the board of trustees and the president, and It was a huge thing. It Was reported on

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.519
The New York Times and so on and we pushed that president out and and there's not been a single

00:13:21.709 --> 00:13:26.100
uprising of that kind against encroachment by the trustees and by the administrations,

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:31.360
and all these decades, passive slaves- Slaves! They *deserve* their slavery.

00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:37.700
Yep, I couldn't agree more. I've thought the same thing about university professors for a long time.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.000
is that they get exactly what they deserve because they never stand up and say, "no,"

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.949
and the fact that- In the United States it's not quite as bad in Canada, i wouldn't say, but the fact that the

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:52.000
students have been essentially handed a bill of indentured servitude here

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.800
for their student loans is absolutely beyond comprehension. You know, it seems to me that the

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.000
bureaucracy has basically conspired to determine how to pick the pockets of

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:07.689
The Students future earnings right and They do that By offering them an Extended adolescence With no quality control

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:15.309
something Like That so it's a real Bargain with the devil and Antle the abandonment of any Kind of Education Actually in history and culture

00:14:15.589 --> 00:14:17.828
All right Think it's gone Along With It that is the

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.209
Transformation into a cafeteria

00:14:20.209 --> 00:14:26.169
Kind of a Menu okay we can Pick This course or that Course of This course without any Kind of Guidance From the University about

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:31.209
A central core curriculum That teaches you history and Chronology and Introduces you to the basics

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:38.469
Because Oh yeah because our professors are such prima donnas they can Only teach in their little areas so we have this total

00:14:39.019 --> 00:14:42.758
Fragmentation okay the Great Art History Survey Courses are being abandoned

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.229
Instead of Lincoln Because Why because graduate students are not trained to see the great

00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:53.289
Narratives or the net Wheel Because we are taught Now that Narratives are false okay so That's another issue that i'd like to bring up

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:59.050
Because One of The Things i cannot figure out is the alliance between the post modernists and the

00:14:59.449 --> 00:15:03.699
Neo-Marxists i can't Understand The Causal relationship There Because the

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:06.758
Tell me if you disagree with This okay because

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:09.139
I'm a Psychologist not a

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:15.188
Sociologist and so I'm dabbling in things that are outside of My Field Of expertise and There Is some danger in that but the center

00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:21.909
The Central post Modernist claim Seems to me that Because There's a Near infinite Number of Ways to interpret a complex set of

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.729
Phenomena Which Which Actually happens to be the case

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:31.299
That You can't make a case That Any of Those Modes of Interpretation are canonical and so if They're not canonical

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.740
If that and if That

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:39.159
Canonical Element Isn't Based in some Kind of Reality Then It Serves some Other Master and so the Master that it

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:45.520
Hypothetically Serves for The post Modernists is nothing But Power Because That Seems to be everything that They believe in they don't believe in

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.189
Competence They don't believe in Authority They don't

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:53.229
Seem to believe in an objective World Because Everything is language mediated so it's an extraordinarily

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.760
Cynical perspective That That Because There's an infinite Number of

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:02.020
interpretations none of Them are canonical You can attribute It everything to power and dominance

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.259
okay so that Does that Seem like a Reasonable Summary of the

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:14.949
Okay it's a Radical relativism Now but the strange Thing Is despite okay and so What Goes Along with that is the demolition of Grand

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:21.370
Narratives and so That Would Be associated for Example with The rejection of Thinkers Like Jung and Eric Norman Because of Course Their

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:29.710
Foundational Thinkers in relationship to the idea that there are embodied grand Narratives That's never Touched but Then

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:36.010
Despite the fact that the grand narrative is Rejected There's a Neo Marxism That's Tightly Tightly allied With

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.450
Post-Modernism That Also Seems to shade Into This strange identity Politics and i don't

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:47.289
Two Things i don't understand the Causal relationship They're like The the skeptical part of me thinks That

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:54.849
Post-Modernism Was a Was an Intellectual its Intellectual camouflage for the continuation of the Kind of Pathological

00:16:55.310 --> 00:17:00.999
Marxism That Produced the soviet union and that has no independent existence As an Intellectual field Whatsoever

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:07.329
but i still can't Understand How the post modernists can Make The no grand narrative claim

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:09.530
But Then

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.099
immerse Themselves in This grand narrative Without

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:20.349
Anyone Pointing Out the evident contradictions like i don't understand that so what do you think about that well i can Only Speak about Literary

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.609
professors Really and They Seemed to me almost Universally in the u.s

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:30.280
To be very naive i they Seem to know nothing about Actual History political science or economics

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.359
So it is simply an attitude They have an attitude it

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:38.629
Marxism and become Simply a Badge By Which They telegraph Their

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:46.939
Their Solidarity With a Working Class That They have nothing to do with i mean Easy and Generally nothing But contempt yes and the Thing

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:54.529
Is that that the campus leftist are almost notorious for their for theirs Rather snobbish Treatment of Staff and They don't They don't

00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:57.859
Have Any rapport With The Actual Working Class members of The

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:04.909
you Know of the infrastructure the janitor The Janitors and you Know even That's even The secretaries there's a Kind of High and Mighty

00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:08.929
Aristocracy You Know but There was Just these are People who

00:18:09.419 --> 00:18:14.839
Who have Wandered into the english department and are products of a Time When

00:18:15.749 --> 00:18:21.439
During The The new criticism may wait When history of history and Psychology had Been Excluded right i Mean My

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:26.840
Ambition okay Was i mean i love the New criticism okay as As a Style of Textual

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.840
Analysis right and and that in the new criticism had

00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:31.320
Multiple Interpretations

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:37.189
Okay that were possible okay and then They were encouraged in fact one of the one of the Great projects was made in max of

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:43.159
Serious 20th Century Views When you had at Least Books i Adored them in college It was about Jane Austen or about you know

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.440
Emily Bronte or about

00:18:45.869 --> 00:18:53.449
Wordsworth and They were collections of alternate views of The same Thing the idea that no alternate views and there was no

00:18:53.820 --> 00:19:01.159
Relativistic the situational Kind of an interpretive approach is nonsense okay i'm but the point was we needed to restore

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.569
History to literary Literary Study okay and we Needed to add

00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:10.069
Psychology to it because it was there was Great animus against freud and When i arrived in

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:16.700
Graduate School in fact i actually went into the director of graduate studies and protested The way freud in Freudian were used as

00:19:17.009 --> 00:19:21.679
negative Terms Play in a Sneering Way by The Very Wasp professors right so we need to do

00:19:22.049 --> 00:19:27.349
Actually It Seemed Like we were moving there came in the Early 1970s Was a Great Period of Psycho

00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:30.289
Biography about Great about political Figures okay

00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:37.368
so i thought it's happening Let's Say and all of a Sudden It all Got Short-Circuited by This arrival You know of post structuralism and

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:41.089
Post-Modernism in The in the in the 1970s right so i

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.200
I feel i'm an old Historicist, okay,

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.460
not a new Historicist.  I having i think new Historicism is an absolute scam.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.540
right and it's like- it's just a way- it's like tweezers do you like Just a

00:19:52.179 --> 00:19:55.319
Little Bit of This a Little Bit of That a Little Bit of that you make a Little tiny

00:19:55.539 --> 00:19:59.519
Salad i guess and I'm some of This Atomized Thing Right it's supposed to

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.879
Mean something it's all to me very superficial Very Cynical a

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:08.969
Very distance i like i am i am the product okay of old historicism the German Philosopher

00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:13.949
Profession When i was a Child What Was Ejected

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:18.269
Archeology Like I'm everything i ever think about or Say Is

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.460
Related to an Enormous time scheme okay from from Antiquity and Indeed from the stone age

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:28.469
and That is the problem with these People: They're mal-educated. The post-Modernists and

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:32.159
Academic Marxist okay are mal educated

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:38.039
Embarrassingly so okay they know nothing before the present. Foucault is

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:40.559
absolutely a joke before the Enlightenment.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.569
Perhaps he might Be useful People to talk about What happens after

00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:52.199
Neoclassicism Which by the way he failed to notice okay a Lot of What he was talking about It turns Out to see be simply

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.700
The Hangover of Neoclassicism okay

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.609
This is how ignorant that Man Was i Mean he's he was he was not Talented as a Researcher he knew absolutely

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.079
nothing okay was so you know nothing about Antiquity how can you make any Kind of large

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.140
structure large mechanism you know to analyze Western culture Without Knowing about

00:21:10.419 --> 00:21:14.369
Classical Antiquity he did not see anything This Was a Person Who had no business

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:20.459
Making Large Theoretical Statements about anything Well Maybe Part of It is that if you if you

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:28.530
Generate an Intelligible doctrine of Radical relativism Then There is no reason to assume that there are distinctions between

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:32.579
Categories of Knowledge or Between different Levels of quality of Knowledge right so

00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:37.979
I've seen The same Thing in in the psychology Departments although We Have the?

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:42.329
What Would you call it the Luxury of being Bounded at Least to some degree by the

00:21:42.429 --> 00:21:46.589
Empirical Method and By Biology Right It's one of The things that Keeps most of the Branches of

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:52.980
Psychology relatively sane you know because the Real World is Actually built into it to some degree but

00:21:53.559 --> 00:21:55.090
If you accept the

00:21:55.090 --> 00:22:01.570
Postmodernist Claim of Radical relativism then You completely demolish The idea That there our quality levels That are associated with Education

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.989
Because Everything Becomes The same and That Seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable Justification for Maintaining Ignorance

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.829
You Know like Foucault i Actually Found Him the most readable of the locka

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.780
Derrida Foucault triad You can Read foucault i Read Madness and

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.329
Civilization and a Couple of His other Books and i thought They were Painfully obvious you know the idea That

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:26.979
Mental disorder Is in part a Social Construct Is self-Evident to anybody

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:33.699
Who has Even a Smattering of psychiatric training i Mean That the Real Narrow medical Types tend to to think of a

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:41.050
Mental disorder Let's Say As something That might Be Purely Biological They have a pure disease Model But Nobody's Who's a

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.480
sophisticated Thinker ever Thinks That it's a

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:49.990
Bit Partly Because medicine Is a Brand of engineering Not a brand of science Because it's associated with Health and the

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.150
Diagnostic Categories are Hybrids Between

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:58.240
Physiological Observation and socio-cultural Condition Everyone Knows That and so When i Read Madness and

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.599
Civilization i thought Well That's Not radical That's Just Bloody

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:09.699
self-Evident But Well you Know Foucault's Admirers Actually Think that he began you know the entire Turn toward a Sort of Sociological

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:16.329
you Know Grounding of Modern Psychology to social Psychology Was well well Launched in the 1920s for

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.640
Examine The Levels of Ignorance of These People Who think foucault Is so original have not Read?

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:26.740
Durkheim They've Not Read Marks of Weber They've never Read urban Goffman okay so in other Words Through to me

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:32.560
Everything Is Foucault Seem obvious to me because i had Read the sources from Which he was Borrowing Without attribution

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:36.879
So i mean Again i know these People i mean i mean in some cases

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.910
Knew them in graduate school People Who went on to become these

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.290
These Admirers of Foucault

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:48.849
Lacan derrida and I know What Their training Was Their training Was Purely Within the english department That's all They ever Knew They never made

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:52.180
Any Research Outside of That Right and so the idea so they

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.700
Foucault is simply This is a Mechanism

00:23:54.950 --> 00:24:02.110
It's like a Little Tiny kit by Which they can approach everything in culture and Then and then They put the contortions of language the

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.969
Deliberate Labyrinth in Elitist language at The same time as pretending to be a leftist

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.800
Okay this is one of the biggest Frauds Every practice so i got a Story to tell you That

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:15.500
you Might Like Because i've Thought a lot about that use of language you know because

00:24:15.809 --> 00:24:20.989
Language can Be Used as camouflage and so, Here's the Story i think i Got this from Robert Sapolsky?

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.990
So he was talking about Zebras and

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:30.920
Zebras Of Course have stripes and hypothetically That's associated with camouflage but it's it's not a straightforward

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:36.410
Association Because Zebras are Black and White and They're on the veldt Along With the lions the lions are

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:43.339
camouflage Because They are grass colored But the Bloody Zebras are Black and White you can See them like 15 miles away, so ok so

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.939
Biologists Go Out to study Zebras and They're Like

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:51.619
Making notes on a Zebra and They Watch It then they look down at Their notes and then They look up but they think oh?

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.340
No, no, Which zebra i was looking at so

00:24:55.340 --> 00:25:00.290
The camouflage is Actually against The Heard Because of Zebras a Herd Animal not an individual and so

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:05.540
The Black and White stripes break Up the animal against The herd so you can't identify It so this Was a

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.959
Quandary for the Biologist so they did one of Two Things One Was

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:15.350
drive a Jeep Up to the to the zebra Herd and use a dab of Red paint and Dab the horns of the zebra or

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.839
tag It with an ear tag Like he used for cattle

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.660
The Lions Would Kill it

00:25:21.179 --> 00:25:23.040
So as soon as it became

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.150
identifiable The

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:25.280
Predator Yes

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:31.219
The predators Could organize Their Hunt Around That identify about animal That's Why you know there's the old Idea That

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:34.939
Lions and predators Take Down the Weak animals but They don't They take down the

00:25:35.309 --> 00:25:39.379
identifiable animals so That's the Thing is if you stick your Damn hand up

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:45.829
You Get Picked off by The predators and so One of The things that Academics seem to do is congregate together and herd-Like

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:50.300
Entities and Then They share a language right and the language Unites them and

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:55.250
Also Keeps Them as long as They share the same set of linguistic Tools Among Themselves

00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:01.250
They're they know that there isn't anybody in the in the coterie That's going to attack them or deeds

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:08.510
Destabilize The entire herd and that Seems to me to account for that impenetrable use of language it's it's it's Group

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.260
Protection strategy and It has Absolutely nothing to do with the search for

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:17.449
It's the Search for Security Within a System and not the desire to Expand the system

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.989
But it'S to me it's Blatantly Careerist Because It Was it was about

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.629
Advancement and It was also about the claim that Somehow

00:26:23.759 --> 00:26:30.088
They have Like Special expertise This is a Special Technical language no One else can Understand That Only Only a Weekend But What's absurd about

00:26:30.089 --> 00:26:31.059
It absolutely

00:26:31.059 --> 00:26:38.309
Ludicrous all Right That These People These These American Academics who are imitating the contorted language of French

00:26:39.249 --> 00:26:41.249
Translations From The French okay

00:26:41.699 --> 00:26:45.419
When Lack Call is translated into into english Right There's a

00:26:45.729 --> 00:26:50.879
Contortion There okay he's what he was trying to do in french Was to break up okay the

00:26:51.399 --> 00:26:52.509
Neoclassical

00:26:52.509 --> 00:26:58.139
Formulations That Descended From arras scene there Was something that Was going on there Was a Sabotage of The french language going on that Was?

00:26:58.269 --> 00:27:02.429
Necessary in france not Necessary in english We Have This long tradition of

00:27:02.649 --> 00:27:06.958
Poetry Going back to the shakespearean Chaucer We Have We Have our own language?

00:27:07.329 --> 00:27:13.139
Far more Vital Than That Than the french oh yeah the french constrain Their language all The time but my dear?

00:27:14.229 --> 00:27:20.968
Facility in Amateurism okay of American Academics trying to imitate okay a

00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:23.369
Chance a chinois

00:27:23.369 --> 00:27:30.419
okay When like Costumes something in france that is Actually not Necessary and Indeed wrong to be doing in english right the

00:27:30.879 --> 00:27:34.379
Other Cynical Abandonment okay of the Great tradition of

00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:41.279
you Know of the english Departments i and iii i felt That the true Radicalism Was not about adding on other

00:27:41.679 --> 00:27:43.149
Departments okay so we have

00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:49.289
African-American Studies and You Know and and and Women's studies and so on the true radicalism would have Been Just to Shatter The

00:27:49.419 --> 00:27:54.868
Departmental structure That's What i wanted i feel that Was the authentic revolutionary Nineteen Sixties Thing to do right

00:27:55.049 --> 00:27:58.978
Tell It to blend all the literate literature studies studies Together okay

00:27:59.859 --> 00:28:02.728
to make Easier to make an interdisciplinary Kind of

00:28:02.919 --> 00:28:08.758
Organization you Know closer to the british Model Where a person can Pursue related Subjects Overlapping Subjects

00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:13.378
These dip These Depart Mental Models okay are were to me

00:28:13.659 --> 00:28:21.059
Totalitarian to Begin With okay separating the language into fiefdom and and and What What this did to create the english What Women's studies Department

00:28:21.819 --> 00:28:28.469
Absolutely Out of The air Just Snap Your fingers and create Women Studies the english department had taken a Century to develop okay that Way?

00:28:28.469 --> 00:28:33.299
It Was a Huge argument okay within Within Within It right and all of a Sudden to create okay

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.610
A department where they

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:40.630
politicize agenda From The start and hey by People Without any training Whatever in that Field i Mean What should Be the what Should be

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.419
The parameters of The field Which Would be the requirements of that Field How about Biology

00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:46.268
okay if you're going to be discussing gender that Should

00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:51.849
Have Been a Number One requirement okay as Part of Any Women's studies department or program but no okay

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
It Was all Hands off It Was Just the

00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:59.679
Administrators Wanted To solve a public relations problem They had a Situation with Very Few Women Faculty

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:07.510
Nationwide at a time When the women's movement had Just started up that spotlight of Attention Was Was on them they want They Needed Women

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:12.369
Faculty Fast They Need to do with the with the women's subject on the agenda fast right so they Just like Poof

00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:18.579
Let There be Women studies okay and Now we'll Just hire some women and usually from english Departments you know

00:29:18.769 --> 00:29:24.879
Here and there and we'll Just Throw them together you invent it you Say What it is so That's Why women's studies Got

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.609
Frozen At a Certain Point of ideologies

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.059
okay of The Early

00:29:29.059 --> 00:29:29.929
1970s i was

00:29:29.929 --> 00:29:37.929
Already in Revolt From It okay i was a precursor in terms of My endorsement of feminism Before It before even Now was created Right

00:29:37.929 --> 00:29:41.798
But i couldn't yeah i couldn't even have a Conversation With Any of These Women They were?

00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:46.449
Hysterical about The subject of Biology They Knew nothing about Hormones and i i mean i i

00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:47.809
Probably Got in fistfights

00:29:47.809 --> 00:29:49.309
Over This They What People were so

00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:55.658
Convinced That Biology had nothing Whatever to do with gender differences see that also Seems to me to be related

00:29:55.659 --> 00:29:59.679
To the postmodern emphasis on power yeah Because There's a There's something?

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:05.589
Terrible Underground Going on there that Is and i think this is the sort of Thing That Was Reflected in the soviet union

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.760
Too and the especially in the 20s When there was this idea a Radical idea that You could

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:15.699
Remake Human Beings Entirely Right Because They have no essential nature and so if your Fundamental

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:23.110
Hypothesis is that nothing Exists Except Power and you believe That then that also Gives you the right in some sense to

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:26.829
exercise Your Power at The Creation of the Kind of Humanity That Your

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:33.669
Utopian Vision envisions and Then That has no that and that also Seems to me to justify the postmodern insistence That

00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:35.419
Everything is Only a Linguistic

00:30:35.419 --> 00:30:41.379
Construct It Again Goes down to the notion of Power Which derrida and Foucault and locke Our so bloody obsessed with and

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:45.100
so and It Seems to me what They're trying to do is to it to take all

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:50.159
All the potential Power for the Creation of Human Beings to Themselves Without Any Bounding Conditions?

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:56.940
Whatsoever right There's no History There's no biology There's and and everything Is a Fluid culture that can be

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:01.950
Manipulated at Will and so i mean in canada there are terrible arguments Right Now about

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:09.750
Biological essentialism Let's Say And One of The Things that Happened Which Was something i objected to precisely a Year ago is that the social

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:15.450
constructionist view of Human Identity has Been Built now into canadian law so there's an insistence That

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.360
Biological sex

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.710
Gender Identity Gender Expression and Sexual Proclivity Very

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.490
Independently With no causal

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:29.550
Relationship Between Any of The levels and so That's in the law and not Only is It in the law it's being Taught

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.210
Everywhere it's being taught in the armed Forces

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:36.419
it's being taught in the police it's being taught to the Elementary School Kids and the Junior High school Kids and

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.820
Underneath It all i see this terrible

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:44.460
Striving for Arbitrary Power That's associated with This Crazy utopianism and and and

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:48.480
but i still don't Exactly Understand It i don't like i don't Understand That

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:54.720
What seems to be the hatred that motivates It that You see bubbling Up for Example in identity Politics and and

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:58.049
in the desire to do nothing But Let's Say Demolish The

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.790
Patriarchy It Kind of Reminds me and this is something else i wanted to talk to you about you know and

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.600
You're you're an Admirer of Eric Norman and all you yeah and That's the

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:12.060
Norman Connection is Really interesting cuz i think he's a Bloody Genius i Really like the great mother Is a Great

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:16.889
Book and I'm Really a Great Warning that. Book and also the origins and History of Consciousness

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.930
Yeah But That's so interesting i Read an Essay that you wrote

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:30.360
Yes it's always Been staggering to me that that book hasn't had the impact that it Should

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.909
Have had i Mean Young Himself in the preface to that book?

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:38.279
Wrote that that Was the book that he wished that he would have Written it's Very Much associated With Young Symbols of

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:43.110
Transformation and It Was a Major influence on my book maps of Meaning Which Was an Attempt to

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:48.419
Outline the universal Archetypes That are portrayed in the Kind of religious structures that you

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:54.840
That You Put Forward but The thing that i really see happening and you can tell me what you think about this in annoyance book?

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:56.890
Consciousness Which is

00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:01.150
Masculine symbolically Masculine for a Variety of Reasons Is is viewed as

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.440
Rising Up

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.700
Against The countervailing Force of Tragedy from an Underlying

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:14.319
feminine symbolically feminine Unconsciousness Right and it's something That Can Always Be pulled back into that unconsciousness That Would Be the

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.380
Microcosm of That Would be The Freudian eatable mother

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.799
Familial Dynamic Where the mother is so over

00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:22.760
protective and all-Encompassing

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:28.959
That She Interferes with the development of The competence not Only of her sons but also of her Daughters of her Children in General and

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.890
It seems to me that That's the

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:34.540
Dynamic That's being Played Out in our society Right Now is that there's this and

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:38.140
It's it's related in some Way that i don't understand to this to this

00:33:38.419 --> 00:33:45.579
Insistence That all Forms of masculine Authority are nothing But Tyrannical Power so the Symbolic representation is

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.400
Tyrannical Father With no

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.470
Appreciation for the benevolent Father and

00:33:50.929 --> 00:33:58.209
Benevolent mother With no appreciation Whatsoever for the tyrannical mother right and That's that and because i thought of ideologies as

00:33:58.369 --> 00:34:00.549
Fragmentary Mythologies That's Where They Get Their

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:07.629
Archetypal and Psychological Power Right and so in a Balanced representation You have the terrible mother and the great mother as?

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.040
Knowing Been Laid Out so Nicely and

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:15.850
You Have the terrible father and the Great Father so That'S the fact that culture bangels you have to Death well it's also?

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:22.659
Promoting you in developing you you have to see that as balanced and then You have the heroic and Adversarial individual but in the?

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.929
Postmodern World and This Seems to be something That's increasingly

00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:30.310
Seeping Out into the culture at large you have nothing but the tyrannical father?

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:36.219
nothing But The destructive Force of masculine consciousness and nothing but the benevolent

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:42.519
Benevolent Great mother and It's a it's an appalling ideology and It Seems to me that it's sucking the vitality

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:49.449
Which is Exactly What you would Expect symbolically it's sucking the Vitality of Our culture you see that with the increasing

00:34:50.359 --> 00:34:51.650
Demolition of

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.030
Young men

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:57.550
and Not Only Young men in terms of Their Academic performance Which like They're Falling Way behind

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:03.820
in Elementary School Way behind in Junior High and Bailing Out of the universities like Mad and so and i

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:09.009
Well The Public school Education become completely Permeated by This Kind of my anti male

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:14.519
Propaganda i mean and i need to me public Schools are Just a form of imprisonment you Know right Now they're particularly

00:35:14.619 --> 00:35:16.919
Destructive to young men who have a Lot of physical Energy

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:23.039
Now you know i identify as transgender gay Mic Myself away but i do not i do not

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:30.240
require the entire world to alter itself okay to fit my particular The self-image i do believe in

00:35:30.579 --> 00:35:37.919
The Power of Hormones i believe that men Exist and Women Exist and They are biologically different i think that i think there is

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.000
No cure for

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.019
The Cultures ills Right Now Except If men Start standing opera in demanding That They be

00:35:46.299 --> 00:35:49.889
Respected As men okay okay so i got a question about That

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:56.069
So so one of The Things we did a research Project a Year ago trying to figure out if there Was such a Thing as

00:35:56.069 --> 00:36:00.149
Political Correctness From a Psychometric perspective to find out if there the loose

00:36:00.819 --> 00:36:02.819
Aggregation of Beliefs Actually Clumped Together

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:09.480
Statistically and We Actually Found two factors Which i won't go into but then we Looked at Things That predicted adherence to that That?

00:36:10.119 --> 00:36:15.959
Politically Correct Creed and There were a couple That were surprising one was being female Was a predictor

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.289
The

00:36:17.289 --> 00:36:23.278
Personality attributes associated With Femininity so that Would Be Agreeableness and higher levels of negative emotion were also both

00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:30.989
independent predictors but so were symptoms of personality disorder Which i thought Was really important Because Part of What i see happening is That

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.639
Like i think that Women whose relationship with men have has Been Seriously?

00:36:36.009 --> 00:36:40.439
Pathologized Cannot distinguish Between male Authority and competence and male

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:48.179
Tyrannical Power Like They fail to differentiate because all They see is the oppressive male and then They may Have had Experiences that That?

00:36:49.809 --> 00:36:55.349
Their Experiences with men might have Been Rough enough so that That differentiation never occurred Because it has to occur

00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:00.059
And You have to have a Lot Of Experience with men and Good men do before that will occur?

00:37:00.309 --> 00:37:08.099
But It Seems to me that we're also increasingly dominated By a view of Masculinity That's Mostly Characteristic of Women who have terrible

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:14.430
Personality disorders and Who are unable to have Healthy relationships with men Now but Here's the problem you know?

00:37:14.799 --> 00:37:20.159
This is something My Wife is pointed Out to she said well men are gonna have to stand up for Themselves but Here's the problem?

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.160
I know how to stand up to a man Who's

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.050
Whose

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:26.430
Unfairly

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:33.020
Trespassed Against me and the reason i know that is because the parameters for My resistance are quite well-Defined Which is

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.339
We talk We argue we Push and then It Becomes physical

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:45.710
Right Like If We Move Beyond The Boundaries of civil discourse we Know what the Next step is ok That's Forbidden in in

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:52.700
Discourse with Women and so i don't think that men can control Crazy Women i don't they i really don't believe it i think That

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:58.970
They have to Throw Their Hands up in in in in what in in it's not even disbelief

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:03.859
It's that The cultural There's no step Forward That You can take Under Those Circumstances

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.460
Because if the Man Is offensive enough and Crazy Enough The

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:11.750
Reaction Becomes Physical Right Away or at Least The Threat is there and

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:16.550
When men are talking to each Other in any serious Manner That Underlying Threat of

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:23.570
Physicality is Always there especially if It's a real conversation and Keeps The Things civilized to some degree you know iF you're talking to a

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:28.669
Man Who wouldn't fight with You under any Circumstances Whatsoever then you're talking

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:33.500
To someone to whom you have absolutely no respect but i can't See any Way for Example

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.440
There's a There's a Woman in in toronto Who's Been?

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:42.139
Organizing This movement Let's Say Against me and some Other People who are gonna do a free speech

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:46.909
Event and she Managed to organize quite effectively and She's quite?

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:52.339
offensive You might Say She compared us to nazis for Example Which you know publicly

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:59.629
Using The Swastika Which wasn't really something i was all That far in Depth but i i'm defenseless against That Kind of female

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.970
Insanity Because The

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:06.859
Techniques That i would use against a Man Who was employing those tactics are Forbidden to me

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:13.159
So i don't know like It seems to me that It isn't men that have to stand up and Say Enough of This even though

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:18.530
That is What They Should do It Seems to me that it's same Women who have to stand up against Their Crazy

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:22.190
sisters and Say Look enough of That enough man-Hating enough

00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:27.559
Pathology enough Bringing disgrace on us as a Gender But

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:32.570
The problem there and then They'll Start My little tirade is that most of the Women i know

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:35.240
Who are saying are Busy doing same Thing

00:39:35.779 --> 00:39:40.008
Right They're off They have Their career They have Their Family They're quite occupied and they don't seem

00:39:40.009 --> 00:39:46.519
To have the time or maybe even the interest to go after Their Their Crazy Harpy sisters and so i don't see any

00:39:46.739 --> 00:39:50.779
regulating Force For That That terrible Femininity and It Seems to me to be

00:39:52.529 --> 00:39:54.209
Invading the culture and

00:39:54.209 --> 00:39:58.428
undermining The The masculine Power of the culture in a Way That's i think

00:39:58.619 --> 00:40:01.788
Fatal i really do Believe that i - i too believe these are

00:40:02.489 --> 00:40:08.899
Symptomatic of the decline of Western culture and We and it Will Just Go down flat i don't think People realize that you know

00:40:09.479 --> 00:40:13.968
Masculinity Still Exists okay in the World As a Code among Jihadists

00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:21.258
Okay and when you have passionate Masculinity okay circling the Borders like The huns and the Vandals during The roman empire

00:40:21.509 --> 00:40:25.339
That's what i see i see this culture rotting from Within okay and

00:40:26.039 --> 00:40:30.049
Disemboweling Itself Literally Now mile an Overview of Why we're having this problem

00:40:30.299 --> 00:40:34.609
and It comes from The fact that I'm the product of an immigrant Family all four of My

00:40:35.219 --> 00:40:37.489
Grandparents and My mother were born in Italy

00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:43.068
so i remember from my earliest Years in This factory Town in upstate New York where the wife of My relatives came to work in

00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:45.889
The shoe Factory i can Remember Still okay

00:40:46.159 --> 00:40:50.599
They the life of the Agrarian era okay which we're not Which Was for most of Human History

00:40:51.269 --> 00:40:52.439
The Agrarian era

00:40:52.439 --> 00:40:59.899
Where there was the World of men and the World of Women and the sexes had Very little to do with each Other

00:40:59.969 --> 00:41:06.259
Each had power and status in its own Realm Right and They Laughed at Each Other in in essence

00:41:06.569 --> 00:41:12.738
The Way the Women had enormous power in fact the old Women Ruled not the young Beautiful Woman Like Today but

00:41:12.959 --> 00:41:18.109
The Older You were the more you had control Over Everyone including the mating and marriage

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:20.718
Um there were no doctors so though

00:41:20.819 --> 00:41:27.018
you had the you know the old Women were like Midwives and Knew all the ins and outs of This and inherited Knowledge about Pregnancy

00:41:27.019 --> 00:41:31.579
and All These Other Things right i can Remember This in the Ignition and and the Joy That

00:41:31.709 --> 00:41:36.709
Women had with each Other all day Long okay cooking With each Other a

00:41:37.259 --> 00:41:43.279
Companions to each Other talking conversing My mother Remembered As a Small Child in Italy When It Was time to do the laundry

00:41:43.499 --> 00:41:48.499
They Would take The Laundry Up the mount up the hill to the fountain You'll soar go okay

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:54.010
And do It by Hand they would sing They Would picnic and so on alright and we Get a glimpse of that in the Odyssey

00:41:54.010 --> 00:42:01.419
When Odysseus is is is Thrown up naked on the shores of phoenicia alright and and he Hears the sound of Women Young Women

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:05.740
Laughing and Singing and it'S no Nikki or the princess Bringing the Women to do the laundry

00:42:05.869 --> 00:42:10.539
He's Exactly The same Thing ok? So there was a Each Gender Had its own?

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:15.280
Hierarchy its own Values its own Way of talking and the sex is rarely

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:21.400
Intersected Like I can Remember in My in childhood and a Holiday Typical ago It could Be a Christmas It could Be a

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:26.409
Thanksgiving Whatever all after Then Women Would be cooking all day Long Everyone Would Sit down to eat

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.540
ok and then After That

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:28.960
ok

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.140
The Women were retired on

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:35.920
Master The Kitchen and the men would go i would i would look at the Food window and see all the men the men would

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.619
Be all outside usually Gather on the car

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:40.690
Ok a time When cars didn't

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:42.560
Work as Well as They do today with the hood up

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.489
Okay and the men Would be standing with Their Hands on Their Hips like That?

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:50.829
Everyone's Staring at The engine and i went Yeah That's how i learned okay men were

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.229
refreshing Themselves By Studying something

00:42:53.359 --> 00:42:57.129
Technical and Mechanical after Being With The Women okay you know for during the Dinner okay

00:42:57.130 --> 00:43:03.910
So so also all of These problems of Today are the direct consequence of Women's emancipation and Freedom from

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:11.230
Housework Thanks to capitalism okay Which made It possible for Women to have Jobs That Said at home for The very first time in the?

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:17.439
Nineteenth Century no longer to be dependent on a Husband or father or brother right and so This Great

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.369
Great Thing That's Happened to us they're allowing us to be totally self

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:28.960
Knowing Self Supporting Independent Agents has Produced all This Animosity about maybe Too Many men and Women Because the Women

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:35.740
Women Feel Unhappy Women Today and Wherever i go whether it's Italy or brazil or England or America

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.750
or toronto okay the of the upper-Middle class professional Women are

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:47.769
Unhappy Miserable They want and They don't know What Why they're Unhappy they want to blame it on men okay the men must change

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:55.090
Men must become more Like Women no that is the wrong Way to go okay it's when men are men okay and

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.900
Understand Themselves As men are

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:02.859
Secure as men then you're going to be happier yeah well there's nothing more Dangerous Than a Weak man Yeah absolutely

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:09.340
Okay especially all These Quislings okay spouting feminists you Hear That okay it Makes me sick but Here's the point?

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:12.820
Men and Women Have never Worked side by side?

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.420
Ever Maybe on The

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:19.269
Farms okay when you were like maybe One person's in the potato field the other Ones over here in the tomato we're Doing Tomatoes or

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:23.259
Whatever okay you you had you had Families Working Working side by side

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:29.590
Exhausted With each Other no time to have It in any Clash of This It Was a collaborative effort on farms and so on

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:37.600
Never in all of Human History have men and Women Been Working side By side and Women are Now the pressure about silicon Valley?

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:38.660
They're also

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:43.180
Sexist oh there there say They don't allow Women in and so on the men are being men in silicon Valley

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:47.140
All right and They Should Be engineers and The Women are demanding that you're oh?

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:51.520
This is terrible You're being sick maybe the sex is okay have their own particular

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:56.739
Form of Rhetoric Their own particular form you know by Density okay maybe okay we Need to

00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:01.360
Reexamine okay this Business about your they may be we have to perhaps

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.059
Accept some degree of tension and Conflict

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:10.630
Between The Sexes okay it in a Work environment i don't Mean Harassment I'm sorry I'm talking about Women Feeling

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:16.390
Disrespective Yeah how some how They're with their opinions When They Express them okay are not taking Seriously or or That

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:21.400
Even Hillary Clinton Is complaining oh When your Woman write something online She's Attacked

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:26.469
Immediately and Sorry Well Everyone's Attacked online What are you talking about the World is tough the World is

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:30.850
Competitive okay identity Is Whole okay by conflict the idea That There's Been no

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:35.289
Conflict That We Have to be in this back okay of approbation yes and

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:38.740
That's the devouring Cycle That's right It's

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:43.989
Absolutely infantile and Mean It okay so a couple of Things there well the first Thing is is that the the

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:49.900
AgreeaBleness trait That Divides men and Women most There's three Things that Divide Women and men most particularly from the

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:55.779
Psychrometric perspective One is that Women are more agreeable Than men and so that Seems to be the primary

00:45:55.970 --> 00:46:03.520
Maternal Dimension as far As i can Tell it's associated with a desire to avoid conflict but it's it's associated with interpersonal Closeness

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:06.699
Compassion Politeness Women are reliably Hired

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:14.129
Especially in the Scandinavian countries and in the countries where egalitarianism has progressed the farthest so That's where the difference is

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.509
Maximized Which is one of the things James d'Amour Pointed Out quite Correctly in His

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:23.999
Infamous Google Memo okay women are higher and negative emotion so That's Anxiety and emotional Pain

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:28.139
Now that difference is approximately the same size and again That

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:33.570
Maximizes in egalitarian Societies Which is Extremely interesting and then The Biggest difference is the

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.790
Difference in interest Between People and Things and so Women are more interested in people and men are more

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:42.779
Interested in Things Which Goes Along quite Nicely with your car anecdote but

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.640
The Thing about men

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:49.230
Interacting With Men again is that It isn't That They respect each Other's Viewpoints

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:55.350
That's not Exactly Right What happens with a Man and i know a Lot of men that i would regard is as

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:58.949
Remarkably Tough People For One reason or another and

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:04.199
Everything You do with them is a form of Combat Like if you want your viewpoint Taken Seriously

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:10.769
Often you have to yell them down and like They're not gonna stop talking Unless you start talking over them you know and it's it's

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:18.330
Not like men are automatically Giving respect to other men Because that Just Doesn't Happen it's that the Combat is there and it's Expected and

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.840
One of the problems

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.399
and so this is part of The reason Why i think men are bailing out of

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:29.520
so much Of Academia and and maybe The Academic World in General and Maybe The World in General is That

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:35.280
Men Actually don't have any Idea how to compete with Women Because the problem is is that if you

00:47:35.859 --> 00:47:37.300
Unleash Yourself

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.889
Completely Then you're an absolute bully and There's no Doubt about that Because iF

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.400
men unleash

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:48.510
Themselves on other men that can Be Pretty Goddamn Brutal especially for the men that are really Tough and this so that Just Doesn't Happen

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:49.900
With Women ever

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:56.220
but so you can't unleash Yourself completely if you win you're a Bully if You lose While you're Just Bloody

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.279
Pathetic so how the hell are you Supposed to play a game like That

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.060
you Know so in i've worked with lots of Women in law Firms in

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:09.989
Canada For Example and and High achieving Women Like Really remarkable People i would Say and They're often

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:16.890
Nonplussed i would Say By The attitude of the man in the law firm because They Would like to see everyone pulling together Because

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:21.929
All Part of The same team Whereas the Manner like at Each Other's Throats in an in a

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.729
Cooperative Way Because They want the law firm to succeed but They want

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:29.010
To be the person Who's at the top of the success

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:34.560
Hierarchy Right so and that that Doesn't Jive well with the more competitive or cooperative

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.009
Ethos That's Part and parcel Of Agreeableness and so

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:43.530
We don't really have any Idea how to integrate male and female Doormen Exactly Exactly

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:46.380
Exactly Right This is Why i love this show

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:53.249
a real Housewives me which is worse Than Mc scorns and Just Say It Just last night okay i was watching on an episode all

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:56.160
Right Where the Women were at each Other okay at a Party and all in

00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:57.070
Recounting

00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:02.429
But i said this to you and but you Said this to me anyway and the men and God we Got together there and Said

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:07.560
Well This is the way they communicate you know with each Other and you know Say in them you know men we men okay

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:12.570
Just Will have a fist fight and we'll Em in ten minutes Later we're gonna have a beer at The bar Where they met next?

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:17.820
To each Other and so i mean i have observed That Land Finland Yeah my Daughter My Daughter used to be really

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.840
irritated about That Because she she like most People

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.080
Was the target of feminine

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:30.419
conspiratorial Bullying At Once She's no pushover My Daughter so this Wasn't like This Was a

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:33.060
Continual Thing or that She Didn't know what to do about it but

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:34.810
She had to observe

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:41.789
These Girls conspiring Against her and then Blackening her name on on Facebook Which is part of It Part and parcel of The typical female

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:49.140
Bullying routine Which is often reputation demolition Right That There's a Good editor on that and then She'd Watch What Would Happen if

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:51.840
My Brother or my son would have a

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:56.969
Dispute with his friends you know and maybe They were drinking and there Was a dispute They'd Have a fight and then The next day

00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:01.169
They were friends again and That's another Thing That strange is that like men have a Way of

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:08.010
Bringing a conflict to a head and Resolving It right and that It isn't obvious to me that Women have that same?

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:13.890
Perhaps You might Call It a Luxury but it's also the case that men don't know what to do when they get into a conflict

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:19.890
With a Woman Because What the hell are you Supposed to do you know Mostly What you're supposed to do is avoid It and and

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:26.969
Well i think you know i don't know whether the crosses into other countries but That there's a Certain Kind of Taunting and

00:50:27.319 --> 00:50:32.778
The Men Boys do with each Other That toughen them okay and where they don't they don't take Things Seriously but

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:38.390
Girls Feelings Become Extremely Hurt if you Hear something like That it's Very Tough for you know again like Sarcastic

00:50:38.789 --> 00:50:41.448
Against her so i mean i do Feel that there are

00:50:41.579 --> 00:50:46.429
Profound differences Between The Sexes and in Terms of Emotions in Terms of communication patterns

00:50:46.529 --> 00:50:49.669
you Know my father used to say That he could never follow Women's

00:50:50.219 --> 00:50:54.289
Conversations he Said he said Women don't even finish Their Sentences They're there with Their Women?

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.170
Understand immediately What the Other Woman is Saying okay

00:50:57.329 --> 00:51:03.589
And and you know in the way Women tend to be more interested in or have Been traditionally more interested in soap operas

00:51:03.719 --> 00:51:05.958
It's not Just The Women were home Without Jobs

00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:08.479
It's that Honestly i believe that Soap opera

00:51:08.609 --> 00:51:12.558
Does Reflect Does Mirror The Way Women talk to each Other They Say these

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:19.009
Communication patterns have Been Built Up through Women in the World of Women okay Which Was It made sense there Was a Division of Labor

00:51:19.229 --> 00:51:23.629
Okay It wasn't Sexism against Women That There Was a Division of Labor The men went off

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:27.739
to hunt and did the Dangerous Things the Women Stayed Around The hearth Because you had pregnant Women

00:51:27.839 --> 00:51:31.818
Nursing Women older Women okay They were cooking and so on so i feel that these

00:51:32.009 --> 00:51:38.478
Communication patterns That we're talking about have Been Built Up became over the centuries and then men had to toughen each Other

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:43.009
okay too hard to go out in the hunting parties the native americans you know it would Be They could be gone for two weeks

00:51:43.009 --> 00:51:48.259
And It went When the temperature was Below zero Many of them died okay yes yeah the idea that somehow

00:51:48.259 --> 00:51:53.269
Oh in any Kind of Separation of The sexes or different Spheres of the sexes Is

00:51:53.519 --> 00:52:01.519
Inherently Sexist yeah an inherently Driven By all powered By Now the Answer to all of This okay everything That we're talking about okay is

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:08.180
Education Into Early History okay until you until People Understand The stone age of a Nomadic

00:52:08.249 --> 00:52:14.119
Period the Agrarian era and the band how culture Health Civilization Built up okay in

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:19.759
Mesopotamia The Great Irrigation Projects Where orange or in Egypt Today Where you had for the first Thing

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:26.479
Centralized Government Authority Became Necessary okay to master these Leaves and you had a Situation where an

00:52:27.089 --> 00:52:33.919
Environmentally You know you know a difficult Situation Like The deserts of mesopotamia or the the peculiar

00:52:34.229 --> 00:52:40.189
Character of Egyptian Geography Where you can Only have a Little Tiny fertile line Along The edges Of a Nile

00:52:40.459 --> 00:52:43.379
okay otherwise desert Landscape so the This

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:49.950
Civilization and Authority Came Right It's not Necessarily about Power Grabbing But about

00:52:51.039 --> 00:52:54.719
Organization to achieve something for the good of The people as a Whole

00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:00.869
yes you Will see That's well That's Exactly The symbolism of the Greeks by Reducing all

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:08.339
Hierarchy to to power you know and and selfish Power okay it's it is utterly Naive its ignorant so i

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:11.760
Say Education has to be totally Reconstituted

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.059
Including Public

00:53:13.059 --> 00:53:18.149
Education to begin in the most distant past it's so that so our Young People Today who know nothing about

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:23.940
How the World Was created Today and Have It okay can Understand okay what Marvelous in particular Like

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:28.769
Paradise They live in and it's the product of capitalist is the product of individual

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:35.099
Innovation it'S the Project most of it'S the product of a Western tradition That Everyone Wants to trash Now is there if you beget in

00:53:35.099 --> 00:53:37.739
The Past and show It also Talk about war Maybe

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:43.200
With the more is the one Thing that Wakes People up okay as we See war as we Need to see

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.519
Yes okay

00:53:44.519 --> 00:53:49.649
Wars The Reality Prints of My of the father and all in five of My Uncle's went to world war two you know and

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:54.299
My Father Was It was Part of The force That Landed in Japan okay a

00:53:55.779 --> 00:53:59.489
paratrooper you Know at The time of The japanese Surrender okay

00:54:00.279 --> 00:54:04.979
and My couple Uncle's Got Shot Up and so on when you have the reality of war When People

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.460
See the reality of The horrors of war Berlin Burned

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:14.789
To a crisp and and so on your starvation okay then You Understand okay in this Marvelous

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.049
Mechanism That Brings Water you know to you to the to the kitchen and you Slip on a Lightly

00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:25.589
The Electricity Electricity cuz i know of for me like and i suppose it's because i have somewhat of a depressive temperament i mean

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:27.130
One Thing That

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:33.480
Staggers me on a consistent Basis is the fact that anything ever Works i Mean Because it'S so unlikely you know to

00:54:33.609 --> 00:54:35.529
To be in a Situation Where our

00:54:35.529 --> 00:54:36.220
Electronic

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:38.819
communications Work where are where our electric Grid

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:44.519
Works and It Works All The time right It Works a Hundred Percent of The time and the reason for that is that there are

00:54:44.519 --> 00:54:51.609
Mostly men Out there who are breaking Themselves into pieces repairing This Thing Which Just falls apart all the time i

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:57.819
Said this in the monk debate okay in toronto Several Years Ago i said there's the invisible all these?

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:03.279
Cds you Know these are the latest in professors sneering and men it'S men who are

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:09.580
Maintaining Everything Around Us or anything This is an invisible Army okay Which of you would you feminists don't notice Right

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:15.910
Nothing Would Work or regarded Regarded as impressive Which is you know and like a professor is someone Who's

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:17.150
Standing on a Hill

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:23.410
Surrounded By a Wall Which is surrounded by another Wall Which is surrounded by another Wall like its walls all the Way down who stands

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:29.920
Up there and Says I'M brave and independent it's like You've Got This protected area That's so unlikely it'S so absolutely

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:36.459
Unlikely and The fact That People Aren't on their Knees in gratitude all The time for the fact that we have central heating and Air?

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:37.700
Conditioning and

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:42.880
pure water and reliable Food it'S Just it'S so It is absolutely unbelievable

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:49.959
Used to die and then the Water Supply me with it with It Was contaminated with cholera for evans Sakes a People Understand okay they

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:55.810
Had Clean Water and fresh Milk fresh orange Juice all of These Things There's a mom at all of The time all the Time

00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:57.350
and That's in

00:55:57.350 --> 00:56:04.360
Western Cultures Is heading okay Because because we are so dependent on this on This invisible infrastructure we're a Heading for an absolute catastrophe

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.350
When

00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:11.769
Jihadists figure Out How to paralyze the power grid the entire culture Will be be

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:15.760
Chaotic You'll Have Mobs in the street okay you know Within three Days

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:20.290
Okay wait a minute so Suddenly the Food Supply iS interrupted and There's no like There's no Way to communicate

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:25.150
They'll Be like You're the robber i mean that that is the way western culture is going to collapse okay

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:30.310
It won't take Much it'S a single point so silly Because we are so interconnected

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.959
Now we are so it's so it's so dependent on communications and computers they

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:36.890
Eat It i

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:42.819
Used to print for Years it'll be an asteroid hitting there yeah well you never Know another i know how the solar Flares Work

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:49.989
so back and this happens about once Every Century so back about 1880 and i don't remember the exact Year There Was a

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:57.219
Significant enough Solar flare so that Produces an electromagnetic pulse like a Hydrogen Bomb Because the sun is a Hydrogen bomb and

00:56:57.710 --> 00:57:04.119
electromagnetic Pulse will emerge from the sun and Wave across the earth and It produces Huge spikes in Electrical

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:11.469
Electrical Current Along Anything That's electronic and it'll Burn Them out it let It live Telegraph operators on fire in the 1800s and

00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:14.320
One of Those Things took out The quebec power grid in

00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:20.199
1985 and Knocked Out The Whole northeast Corridor and so They figure those Things are about 1 in a Century event

00:57:20.359 --> 00:57:27.789
But Those single While you have My brother-in-Law Who's a Very Smart guy he designed the chip an iphone we were talking about political issues

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:31.330
The last time i went and Saw Him in San Francisco and His notion Was That

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:37.510
All That The Government Should Be Doing right Now is stress testing our infrastructure the same way They stress test the banks

00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:42.730
Because we're so full of These single Points of Failure that and i think you're absolutely Right Luckily we've Been

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:44.930
What Would you call

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:48.220
Invaded By Stupid Terrorists Instead of Smart Terrorists Because a

00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:52.749
Smart Terrorist Could do an unbelievable Amount of damage in a Very short Period of Time

00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:56.320
So and it's Just God's Good graces that that hasn't Happened yet

00:57:56.780 --> 00:58:02.590
And so What Will Happen is that it's the men ok the men will reconstruct

00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:08.919
Civilization While The Women cower in the Houses and have the men go out and do all The Dirty Work That's What'S gonna Happen again?

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.499
Only men Will Bring Civilization back again

00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:16.149
so what ok so now a couple of Things so the

00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:18.350
Universities i Mean i've

00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:21.879
proposed although it'S something That's probably Beyond my Power That

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:28.719
What Should Happen is that the Universities the real content of The universities Should Be Stolen back from the universities Because They're not making Use

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:35.169
of Their Intellectual property and that something Should Be Started online That Would constitute a genuine University The problem is the

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:37.420
Accreditation issue but i don't think That's an

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.179
Unsolvable problem but do you see

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:47.259
Like All These People Who have these Postmodern neo-Marxist Agendas are completely embedded Inside the University

00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:52.150
And the point is over over the last 25 Years i Have received constant mail?

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:55.150
From People Dropping Out of the graduate Schools

00:58:55.250 --> 00:59:01.239
and or giving up all Together on any Idea of being a college professor so What's happened is that The most Talented and

00:59:01.310 --> 00:59:08.139
Independent Thinking People They have Avoided in the Schools so we're now what who we have are the compliant the servile ok?

00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:12.359
The People Who are currently in the university and and Hiring Their Successors They are

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:17.040
Male educated Themselves okay me i went on the first letters i received in the Early?

00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:22.439
1990s i'll never Forget It so I'm a Woman who was now to painting Houses in missouri and

00:59:22.570 --> 00:59:24.570
Said she had Been Part of the comparative literature

00:59:25.119 --> 00:59:32.608
graduate program at You know at Berkeley and that she Finally had to drop Out because she said every time she would Express

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:40.889
Enthusiasm for What They were reading the People looked at her as if she had somehow accredited offense and although in other words

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:46.859
Enthusiasm For Art or Neither The Very Things you Need as a teacher in the classroom okay we're being

00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:53.279
Retrained Out Yeah well the Thing is if you respect art literature that means that you

00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:56.909
Implicitly Accept a Hierarchy of quality right and That of Course

00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:03.540
Contradicts The Fundamental tenants of The Postmodern doctrine Which is that there are no Hierarchies of quality and you know you

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:05.589
Talked a Little Bit earlier about the

01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:09.389
The idea that You Referred again to the idea that everything is

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:14.129
Associated With Power and That's That's the Thing that i can't That That's the thing that i can't Help but

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:19.260
associate with with a Kind of Personality Pathology Like You Know from a psychometric

01:00:19.569 --> 01:00:24.119
perspective The best predictors of Long-Term Success in our society are intelligence Iq

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.270
Which you can Measure Very accurately and trait

01:00:27.609 --> 01:00:28.599
conscientiousness Which

01:00:28.599 --> 01:00:34.469
Actually Is a Real testament to the culture right Because What you hope is that the Smart People Who Work hard are the people who

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:39.959
Advance no It isn't like They deserve It Exactly that isn't What i mean it's that if the culture is

01:00:40.599 --> 01:00:46.139
Harnessing The productive Power of individuals properly Then It Should differentially Reward People Who are smart and

01:00:46.329 --> 01:00:51.119
Conscientious Because They're going to do a bunch of Really interesting Work for the rest of Us and that That's Very well-Established

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:55.530
Finding it's it's as Good as any finding in the social Sciences but

01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:01.919
despite that and despite the fact that everything Works Which is a Goddamn miracle of sorts There is This

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.129
Consistent Story That We live in a

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.369
Patriarchy That It's only

01:01:06.369 --> 01:01:12.689
oppressive That it'S done nothing But Oppress Women since the Beginning of time Which is also something That Just Boggles my mind you know

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.079
Like i know they have Sacrificed for Women and Children?

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:22.550
Hakuna Their Lives okay for Thousands of Years You know yes there's Been Brutality but the brutality is the Minority

01:01:23.059 --> 01:01:25.219
okay yes This this is sick i

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:31.729
Portrayal of Human History is nothing But male oppression and female victim inch i Mean This is a Way to

01:01:31.859 --> 01:01:38.989
To permanently ensure the infantilization of Women yes yes well and you Know there did you can Even make the case from a Purely logical

01:01:39.359 --> 01:01:41.359
Perspective so so Here's an interesting

01:01:41.369 --> 01:01:43.200
Here's an interesting fact

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.129
So most of The People Who abuse their Children

01:01:46.859 --> 01:01:48.859
were abused as Children

01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:53.329
But most of The People Who were abused as Children don't abuse their Children

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.179
Right so if you look at the population of abusers They were all abused so you can Say abuse causes abuse

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:06.379
But That's That's not a good idea because you have a specific Sample there right It's not a Random Sample What happens is that abuse?

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:13.249
Dampens Out of Over the centuries It Doesn't propagate itself and That's obvious Because if there Was if the

01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:16.699
Hypothesis of Essential male Tyranny Was true it Would Spread

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:22.940
Exponentially Through The Population in like three generations and There Wouldn't be an Exception at all and so What Happens is

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:27.709
Even When there is a Tilt Towards Tyranny Let's Say in the family or even in the society That

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:33.920
Regresses back to something That'S far more Benign Very Very rapidly and you see this so

01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:43.159
One of the biggest Unexamined Issues Is the transition from the Great extended Family of old okay into the Nuclear Family and

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:45.829
I do Feel That freud is the best

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.470
Analyst of The particular Kind of Claustrophobic

01:02:49.319 --> 01:02:51.439
Cell of The Modern Nuclear

01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:52.230
Family

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:57.740
It could Be The Human being It could Be That Human Beings were never intended okay to be trapped in a house Just With Their

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:03.949
Parents The Extended Family They were you and your Aunts and you know and Grandparents and and in cousins

01:03:04.319 --> 01:03:10.039
All of Whom Helped form your identity okay so one had One's identity Was What is a Member of a Community

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:14.299
Rather Than in this like hothouse environment so i think a Lot of Current issues

01:03:15.119 --> 01:03:20.899
Including This subspace of Transgender Claims and so on that a Lot of These Things are coming from

01:03:21.569 --> 01:03:24.169
This unstable Of in

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:31.799
in itself it's really a Prison cell okay of the Nuclear Family Two parents Perhaps Cannot give all The knowledge of Life okay to

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.710
The Young and so i think there are all Kinds of?

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:41.190
Sexual Issues you know that are generated by It but with the you know Psychology today

01:03:41.619 --> 01:03:44.098
Is is now it's simply a

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:46.980
Magical Matter People come in

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:50.309
you Know the psychologists in the United States Deals With Your

01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:56.609
Present problem Let's not Go into the distant past okay Let's Just deal with our present problem Which are Which obviously we Have Forms of?

01:03:56.799 --> 01:04:04.439
communication We Need to like fix this and then You'll be fine as a Consequence There's a complete absence of any Kind of Analysis of

01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:06.700
Your Experiences As a Child

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:11.669
With Your Parents so you know with you with your siblings and so on how that might relate to your current

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:18.809
Sexual Identity Issues Whether it's transgender or whether it'S homosexuality It is impact you could not Possibly Ask me about any

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:23.069
Genesis of homosexuality Today okay Because that is automatically Defined as

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:28.049
Homophobic well Excuse me every single it's an open Link game you know the person myself

01:04:28.329 --> 01:04:34.979
Every gay person i know okay there's some Story there okay Seems to me in childhood not only that There's a strange?

01:04:35.859 --> 01:04:36.819
Similarity of The

01:04:36.819 --> 01:04:42.508
Storylines of All of My Friends Who are gay okay there's a Same pattern That had to do with Blurred border Lines in

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:46.259
Between i a son and His mother and so on i'm not blaming the mother

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:52.289
Okay i'm not blaming the mother at all okay what i see is a Dynamic going on in the bourgeois house or the Nuclear Family?

01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:59.670
Where you had sometimes a Distant Father okay a Father who was present but it but in that not Really engaged and a mother who

01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:04.739
Make me the son her companion in some way often the mother has Great

01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:09.209
Imagination and Flair They had a Shared Thing and i mean i think the idea that homosexuality

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:15.000
Has nothing Whatever to do okay with Your Family life is not well it's also completely

01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:18.929
Well That's another Thing and i got a Lot of trouble in canada for My

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:22.500
Opposition to bill C16 Which Was a bill that had to do with

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.209
Transgender rights and i didn't Really give a Damn about the transgender right issue that had nothing to do with it

01:05:27.329 --> 01:05:30.268
What bothered me was that there Was an issue of compelled Speech

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:37.650
Because You were required by the on Terry Human Rights Commission to use the pronouns that of the person's choice right otherwise then

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:41.550
Absolutely or well in that Concern and it's absolutely intolerable

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:45.810
you Know i i have said i Said Years ago okay that my book Sexual persona Which Was like a

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:53.039
700 page book i said that is the biggest sex change in history because i okay with My transgender issues all right don't

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.040
Look to the magnificent

01:05:55.420 --> 01:06:01.499
Construction of English okay It Was the english language okay that i seized on to gain My

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.220
Identity and My Power as a person right and Therefore Any

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:11.220
Intrusion Into english Someone Tongue Trying to tell me how to use english This Great gift okay to me

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.940
This is absolutely obscene and Evil any Company to try to

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:19.350
Dictate to us how we're going to use this missing It Was an instrument of english yes

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:24.690
Absolutely and and that Was for me the breaking point because i believed well and i think that That's?

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.619
Associated With The idea of the logos in the west you know Because That's a deep

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:34.499
Mythological Idea That the logos is the Thing that Brings order Out of chaos through communicative Speech and that That's

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:41.340
Tightly Aligned With Your soul and i don't care if you're an atheist or a Believer It Doesn't Matter it's still the right

01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:43.410
language and That no one has any right Whatsoever

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:50.339
Under Any Circumstances to Trespass against That and so but That's okay Because That's law in canada Now and so

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:54.659
But okay so now back to your let's see you were making a Point about

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.739
Yes okay because it's it's interesting to look at These Things from

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.220
Obviously for multiple

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:12.809
Perspectives Which is another Thing the ideologues don't do right Because for them everything Is one cause There's One That's how you can tell When

01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:18.420
You're Dealing With someone Who's ideologically Possessed is They Make everything attributable to a single cause like Power

01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:23.220
So but so one of the things That's Happened with the Nuclear Family That'S quite interesting too is That

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:27.450
Parents are older and They and They Have Fewer Children

01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:32.460
So you could imagine that that hothouse environment in some sense is being

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:35.279
Exaggerated for a Bunch of Reasons One Is

01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:40.680
Well Your Child is a Lot more Valuable to you iF you're older and you only Have one or two?

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:46.399
Right Because you're Not going to get another chance That's first of all you might Have had some Trouble having the Job to begin With?

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:52.639
And you're not gonna get another chance so you've Got all youR Eggs are in one basket so to speak and then of Course

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.000
Children don't have?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.439
The Number of Siblings They used to have and one of The Things That's Really Useful about having siblings is that They Keep you in

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:05.239
Your place right They Their Primary socialization agents and i Mean that can Be Brutal

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:09.979
and That's Reflected Say in the story of Cain and Abel you know that that internal Household

01:08:10.049 --> 01:08:15.979
Dynamic with Siblings can Be can Really Become Murderous and That has to be kept under control but i think the the

01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:20.569
Hothouse Flower person Who's Who's incapable of

01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:26.749
tolerating Any Jobs or Any or Any testing Any dominance Hierarchy testing of The sort that you Said that men do

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:31.279
Part of That's The consequence of being Raised by older Parents Who have Excess Resources

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:39.349
Who have no siblings because the child is then of course special and that specialness well there seems to be an inverse

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:41.630
relationship Between that specialness

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:49.459
That's protected and the person's Robustness and resilience and so and then That's caught into or not caught into That's That's

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:57.799
Pandered to by the universities Which insist upon setting up a situation where no one is ever offended by anything

01:08:58.410 --> 01:09:02.029
Any Of The time and That's something i also can't understand at All Because

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:06.949
That's a Huge point you Just made okay because it's the upper Middle Class of the

01:09:07.589 --> 01:09:11.959
Professional Class Who Postpones having the Children okay Because They go to law School

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:18.139
They Go to medical school all right and They and They have the Children after They're Settled okay in a Job okay so?

01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:22.669
They're the ones okay who have injected This this this?

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:27.379
hypersensitive Bourgeois Aidid You Know code into the universities Now my parents

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:32.359
Were twenty When they Married in 21 when They had me okay it made my father was

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:37.129
You Know went to college on the gi bill getting out of Out of World war. Two so i

01:09:37.319 --> 01:09:43.369
When i was Born my Father Was still in college and Was sweeping full went to floors and so on i am the product of

01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:45.769
Young Parents and nature Wants

01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:52.129
Actually Young Compared Ins right Because Because Pregnancy Is is quicker it's Safer okay and so

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:56.150
on and my Parents Had The Energy - You Know They're this useful Energy That

01:09:56.490 --> 01:10:01.039
can-Do spirit That came Out of World War two and so on i'm talking about then then

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:06.709
Not Only other Sibling It Was Born 14 Years Later okay my father this point Was a college professor

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:14.720
right so she had completely different parents Than i did so she has Very Excellent Manners and so She's completely different okay right

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:18.920
And i have all This Like The Energy of My Parents Were Just Out of Their Teens?

01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:24.409
But Not Today We Have this situation no and it's considered Heresy to raise this issue okay

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:30.950
That you have Have Young Women are told okay There's one future for you you are a future leader okay you must you must move

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:36.200
Forward okay four Years of college and The purpose Was a professional Class okay all right so it

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:41.810
May Be the women young Women's bodies are signalling okay that They want to be

01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:44.270
Another's Maybe Maybe There are

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.200
Signals coming From The Body

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:52.459
Right of Maybe Now one Thing this this this this System of Education That Was devised for men okay this being

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.100
Funneled Along Channel Along its

01:10:55.230 --> 01:10:55.850
Mechanism

01:10:55.850 --> 01:11:02.360
Alright so young Women you know Feel Unhappy they don't know why they Feel They have no sense of Identity Yeah if they if they

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.360
want to marry and Drop Out of college

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:11.540
And Have a Baby They Will be treated as traitors to their class What you are future leader What have a Baby Only?

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:18.200
Working-Class Women Would Do That okay know What i find Working-Class Women okay in General okay far more

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:24.349
Rounded as personalities okay They Express Themselves Forcefully They Have Body language that Takes Up space

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:28.670
okay a Man Says something to them on the street They are right back in their face and so on

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:33.619
It's the Bourgeois Girls okay who are talked to they're there because They are special okay we have to postpone

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:39.470
Actual Life okay from for all These Years You See these these are the girls who are who misjudged

01:11:39.570 --> 01:11:46.880
The Fraternity parties setting These are the Girls Who like robbing for parental Protection and Hand-Holding on the on the committee?

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:51.860
Investigating What went wrong in their day and so on so forth so yet so yes i i think that What you that you have?

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:57.349
Located That's Very interesting The idea That These These Young Girls okay who are so

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:04.610
sensitive okay in college so unable to handle their sex life are the product of older Parents Because They went through The professional career track

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:09.860
Right Yes and They They have not had the experience of the you know

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.940
competitiveness you Know it will end Up and and teasing of Other Siblings

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:20.450
As well also You have a Thing about Young Parents is They don't care as much As older Parents and that Actually Turns Out to

01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:22.290
Be Better Because

01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:25.220
What you really want for Your Children is minimum Necessary

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.369
Intervention right and and the developmental literature is Actually quite clear on this so iF you're at home With your Child

01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:35.809
What the best role that you can Play Is to be there but not to be

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.919
Interacting With The Child all The time the child Should Be off Doing Whatever it is the Children do which?

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:45.020
Generally is Playing With Other Children right Without It being Mediated also By Screens and

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:48.169
Technology Because That's how they formulate Their identity and

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:52.970
That's how They Learn to play Joint Games with other People and the parent is supposed to be there as a

01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:54.390
recourse for The Child

01:12:54.390 --> 01:13:00.110
When They go out a Little Bit farther Than they can tolerate and They have to come back and Get some security and so but

01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:05.239
That Isn't That's especially not What happens to single Children Because They're Basically Raised as miniature Adults

01:13:05.850 --> 01:13:08.420
so When i wonder - Like How much of the

01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:13.219
Antipathy Towards That These are Dark Musings and i would Say How much of the

01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:17.150
Antipathy Towards Men That's being Generated By Say college-Age Women Is

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:24.920
Deep Repugnance For the role That They've Been designed and a disappointment with the man for who you know like you think of those

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:27.830
Carpathian or

01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:30.780
I

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:32.430
Can't remember the culture

01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:37.010
The Basic Merit Marital Routine Was to ride into the village and grab the

01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:41.059
Bride and Run Away with her on a horse right it's like the like the motorcycle

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:46.789
Gang Member Who rips the two naive Woman Out of Girl out of the bosom of her family

01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:52.429
There used to be bride stealing It Was quite a bit quite quite Widespread

01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:59.989
Right Now so i kind of Wonder iF Part of The reason That Modern University Aged Women Aren't so aren't so Angry is Because That

01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:08.119
Fundamental feminine Role is Actually Being Denied to them and They're They're objecting to that At a Really Really Fundamental Level like a Level of

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:13.309
primitive outrage well Because What Happened is the chaos That my Generation

01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:19.309
Of 1960s Bequeathed Through The Sexual revolution i When i arrived in college 1964

01:14:20.130 --> 01:14:25.159
The colleges were still acting in local Parentis in Place of a Parent so at my Dormitory

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.930
Were all Women's Dormitory

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:33.950
We Women had to sign in at 11 o'clock at night the men could Run free the entire night so it was my Generation of

01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:40.220
Women that rose Up and Said give us the same Freedom as men have and the colleges replied no

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:46.820
In the World is Dangerous that You could Be raped We Have to protect you against rape and what we Said okay was

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:51.289
Give us the Freedom to risk rape okay and so That What That?

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.600
Today's Women to Understand it's a

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:58.610
Freedom That You want it's the same Freedom That give gay men have when they go and they pick Up a Stranger

01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:00.030
someplace They know it's Dangerous

01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:06.110
They Know they could end up beaten Up or Killed okay but They find it hat If you want Freedom if you want Equality

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:11.329
Okay then you have to start Behaving like a Man Know so what We did is we Gave Freedom

01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:13.940
to these Young Women for Several Generations

01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:21.590
But My Generation had Been Raised in a far more Resilient and Robust culture okay we had the strength okay to

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:27.800
Know What we wanted and to fight for What we Wanted these Young Women have Been Raised in This protective terribly Protected Ways?

01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:35.659
So i think in some strange you know the fashion that that all these Demands for Intrusion from these you know

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.650
stalinist

01:15:37.650 --> 01:15:39.570
Committees Sexually You Know

01:15:39.570 --> 01:15:42.529
Investigating Dates and so on it's a Way to reinstitute

01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:47.120
Tooken a The Rules that My Generation Threw Out the window i saw i think these Young Women are

01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:49.909
Desperate not Only that but i have spoken Out Very?

01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:54.979
Strongly in you know in a piece i wrote for time magazine that isn't my most Recent book

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.280
That the

01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:03.829
Raising the Drinking age in this country okay from 18 to 21 okay has had a Direct result okay in these in these disasters of

01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:11.690
Binge Drinking Fraternity parties Because It's a Lot Let constants The Way we could Go out as Freshmen Have a Beer?

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:18.559
Sit in a protected adult environment Learn How to discourse with the opposite sex in a safe you know

01:16:18.810 --> 01:16:19.380
Man

01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:25.940
Environment right and so on and you and not today okay because because of the stupid role That Young People can't even buy a Drink

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:31.819
A you know in a bar Until the 21 we have these the fraternity parties that are like it'S a Caveman era

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:37.519
Well of Course in modern Age This is Advantages men okay men want to hook Up men want

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.310
To have sex?

01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:43.759
Women don't understand What men want so you know iF Women Women are like Put Out Because They're hoping that maybe the man Will continue

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:49.940
To be interested in them okay the man Just Wants experience okay i mean that the Hormones drive Toward turning to me i'm

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:54.020
Serious okay that the you know they that the sex drive in men is

01:16:54.330 --> 01:17:00.169
Intertwined With With Hunted pursuits okay yes yes i Feel absolutely This is What Women don't Understand okay

01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:07.969
And if Women understood What i understand from My transgender perspective all right with These Women on the streets okay you know i know i'm

01:17:08.219 --> 01:17:12.049
Obviously you know Madonna you know an Admirer and you know and i

01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:14.280
Support Pornography and Prostitution

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:20.210
so i don't want what i'm about to say It's a seeming conservative Isn't It isn't okay what i'm Saying is the women on the

01:17:20.210 --> 01:17:24.259
Street Young Women okay who are about who are Jogging okay with no

01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:31.730
Bra on okay short Shorts and have and Have earbuds in Their Ears okay Just Jogging the long As i saw These Women do not?

01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:35.960
Understand The nature of the Human Mind they do not Understand the nature of

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:42.589
Psychosis okay and This intertwining Them talking about of The hunt the Hunter pursuing Things okay They're

01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:46.069
Triggering a Hunt Thing Just What you would

01:17:46.710 --> 01:17:52.100
You You have talked about in terms of the Zebra Herd okay They are triggering the hunt game

01:17:52.650 --> 01:17:54.420
Impulse okay in

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.420
Psychotic men okay

01:17:56.820 --> 01:18:00.889
There Goes a Very appetizing and and and totally Oblivious

01:18:01.409 --> 01:18:05.449
Animal okay Bouncing Along Here and we're in a Period Now where

01:18:05.850 --> 01:18:10.249
Psychosis is not understood at all okay Young Women have had no exposure to

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.159
Movies Like Psycho okay well

01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:19.069
you Know the Kind of The Rapists Serial Murderer Things so on the Kind of strange

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:24.560
Dynamic That has to do with It with an assault on the only a mother in Michael you know in in the in the mind

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:31.100
Of a Psychotic i think this is an incredible naivete these Young Women are emerging and going to college and in in this like incredible

01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:34.250
Dye Nation environment of You know a

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:37.850
Sector Orgy Astok Sexual Experience in fraternity Houses

01:18:37.949 --> 01:18:44.089
They're completely unprepared for It right and and so you're getting all This outrage so feminist Rhetoric has gotten more and more

01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:50.870
reme and its portrayal of men as Evil but in fact ok What we Have is a caste you Say it's a chaos in the

01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:57.019
Sexual Realm The Girls Have Not Been told anything real i Mean in terms of Biological

01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:02.060
Substrate of Sexual no Way There's Full of lies about What constitutes consent to

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.690
become something That's essentially Portrayed

01:19:06.150 --> 01:19:08.449
linguistically As a Sequence of progressive

01:19:08.699 --> 01:19:14.449
Contracts Which You know is it's well i think you know i've thought for a While that we're living in the delusional

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.690
Fantasy of a Naive

01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:23.390
Thirteen Year old Girl Thoughts Basically Sums Up our culture and i look at all these Sexual Rules that permeate the the the

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:26.509
Academia and i think two Things the first Thing i think is well i?

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.949
Know Because i was an Alcohol Researcher for a long time and you know that 50%

01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:37.969
Of Violent Crimes are directly attributable to alcohol so if you're murdered There's about a 50% chance That you're drunk and

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:41.359
About a 50% chance that the person who Kills you is drunk and

01:19:41.699 --> 01:19:47.899
Alcohol Is the only drug That we Know that Actually amplifies Aggression It Does that in laboratory situations Plus It's a Great

01:19:48.239 --> 01:19:52.999
Disinhibitor Right So What Alcohol Does is it it Doesn't make You oblivious to the future

01:19:53.190 --> 01:20:00.290
Consequences of Your action Because if you ask someone Who's drunk about the consequences of something Stupid They can tell you what the consequences are

01:20:00.449 --> 01:20:07.189
but It Makes you not care and It Does that Because it's technically an Exile itta click like Barbiturates or like

01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:10.819
Benzodiazepines and It also Has an Activating

01:20:11.969 --> 01:20:18.139
Property for Many People Who drink so it's it's a stimulant and A-- and an Anxiety Attack at The same time and

01:20:18.239 --> 01:20:23.539
a Very very potent it's very potent for both of them and you know we put Young People together and

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:29.390
Douse them in Alcohol right at The binge Drinking Level and Then Which also interferes with Memory consolidation

01:20:29.489 --> 01:20:36.619
Which of course Makes Things Much more complex and then we're Surprised When there are Sexual Misadventures and you know and then it's also attributed

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:42.529
Almost Purely to the predatory element That's That's part and parcel of Masculinity but a

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:47.390
Tremendous Amount of That Is also Naivety and Stupidity you know Because we Expect Like

01:20:47.699 --> 01:20:54.799
80 18 year old Guys especially The Ones That Aren't That Haven't Been Successful with Girls Which is like 85% of them Because the

01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:57.410
Successful men are a Very small percentage of men

01:20:57.810 --> 01:21:02.840
The 85% who haven't Been Successful with men or with Women They don't know What the hell they're doing at All

01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:05.360
right and Part of The reason They're getting Drunk is to

01:21:06.330 --> 01:21:09.169
Garner Up enough Courage to actually make in Advance

01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:16.910
You Know and Because i think another Thing That Women don't understand especially With Regards to young men is Just Exactly how petrifying

01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:25.099
attractive Woman Who's of Say Somewhat Higher status Actually is to a young guy and there's Lots of Guys That write me

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:30.740
Constantly and People That I've Worked with that are so terrified of Women They can't even talk to them it's very Very common

01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:32.670
Well you know i take a Very

01:21:32.670 --> 01:21:34.670
Firm Position Which is that i

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:40.910
Want college Administration's to stay Totally Out of the social Lives of The students right If a Crime is committed

01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:47.360
It Should Be reported to the police i've Been writing That for 25 25 Years Now all right but but it's not the business of

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.330
Any College

01:21:48.330 --> 01:21:54.860
Administration to take Any notice okay of What to students Say to each Other Say to each Other as Well As do With each Other

01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:56.929
okay i want it totally stopped is

01:21:57.300 --> 01:22:00.379
Fascism of the war yeah i agree why are you sitting it's i think it's

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:05.300
Fascism of The worst Kind Because it's an it's a New Kind of fascism you know it's

01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:10.519
It's partly Generated By Legislation so they like The title nine man memo that Was written in

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:16.700
2011 i Recently Got a Copy of That Goddamn Thing That Was One polluting Bit of Legislation That Was that memo

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:24.439
Basically Told Universities that Unless They set Up a parallel Court System They were going to be Denied Federal Funding It is absolutely unbelievable

01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:30.270
No, no

01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:38.149
There is no authentic Campus leftism I'm sorry It's a Fraud okay i mean you think the faculty Should Be fighting the administration's

01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:41.310
Federal

01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:43.700
Regulation of You Know how we're Supposed

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:50.689
To behave on campus well how can you be so how can you be so naive and foolish to think that taking an

01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:54.320
Organization Like The University Which already has Plenty to do and

01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:59.599
Forcing It to become a Pseudo Legal System That

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.740
Parallels The Legal System

01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:08.659
Could Possibly Be anything But Utterly Catastrophic It would Mean You have to know absolutely nothing about the legal system and about the

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:11.409
Tremendous Period of Evolution That Produced

01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:14.290
What's Actually a Stellar system and an

01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:20.619
Adversarial System That Protects The Rights of The Accused and of the end of the victim and to replace That with an ad-hoc

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.240
Bureaucracy That Has Pretty Much

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:28.030
Essentially The same degree of Power as The court System with absolutely none of the training and none of the Guarantees

01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:34.540
Your records They were taking that piece that i wrote about date rape It Was in January 1991

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:40.480
Newsday Got But There's the most controversial Thing i ever wrote in my entire career i attacked the entire thing and

01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:46.389
Demanded The college Just stand back and Get Out of the social Eyes of The students so on and People the up

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:51.099
Reaction People Try to occult They called the president of the My University Try to get me fired

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:53.949
You can't believe hysteria okay i can believe

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.949
AnyThing That Says to women okay that They Should be

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:07.059
responsible For Their own Choices is Regarded as

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:12.609
Reactionary are They Kidding me okay this is such a Betrayal of Authentic feminism in my view

01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:17.800
Well it's the ultimate betrayal of Authentic feminism Because it's it it's an

01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:24.910
Invitation of All The Things that you might Be paranoid about With Regards to the patriarchy back into your life right it's an

01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:32.349
Insistence That The most intrusive part of the tyrannical King come and Take control Over the most intimate details of Your life

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.680
Incredible

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:38.260
And The The assumption is that That's going to make Your life better Rather Than worse right

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:43.690
Not to mention this idea of You Know That's the stages of verbal consent as if as if Your

01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:46.630
Impulses Based in the Body have anything to do with words

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:51.070
And so on i mean That's the Whole point is you do a lot sex okay it's to abandon

01:24:51.230 --> 01:24:54.129
okay that you know that They're part of the Brain That's so that You know

01:24:54.290 --> 01:25:01.029
Inin trammeled With Words i Mean Yeah there's you see these two actually a Marker of Lack of social Ability

01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:07.179
To have to do that Because IF you're sophisticated it's not like iF you're dancing with someone it's not like you call out the moves

01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:13.779
Right If You have to do that Well then Your your your your more Worse Than the Neophyte right an Awkward

01:25:14.119 --> 01:25:19.539
Neophyte and Anybody with Any sense Should Get The hell away from you and so If you're reduced to the point where you

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:25.089
Have to Verbally negotiate every element of intimate interaction then What a downer That

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:27.940
yes but What i what an

01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:33.280
Unbelievably What Would You call It naive in Pathological view of the manner in Which Human Beings interact

01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:37.959
There's no sophistication in that well what i'm worried about also in this age of social media

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.060
I've noticed as a teacher in the classroom

01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:49.900
That The Young People are so used to communicating Now by cellphone okay by iPhone

01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:50.820
That's They're Losing Body language and Facial

01:25:51.650 --> 01:25:54.310
Expressions okay Which i think is going to compound the problem

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.860
With with these dating

01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:01.000
encounters okay Because the ability to Read the Human face

01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:03.460
Into into to Read Little Tiny

01:26:03.679 --> 01:26:09.939
Inflections of Emotion Well i think My Generation Got That from Looking at Great Foreign Films With her with Their long

01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:12.100
tanks okay so you have Jean Marais and

01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:18.730
okay in like in potential romantic encounters and You could You see the tiniest little little inflections all Right

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:22.959
That That Signal communication or Sexual readiness or

01:26:23.210 --> 01:26:27.879
Irony or skepticism or distance or Whatever okay but the inability to read the

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:33.489
Other People's Intentions okay that i think this is going to be a disaster i i Just noticed That

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:39.130
How year by Year okay the students are becoming much more Flat Affect

01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:42.489
okay and They Themselves complain That They'll Sit in the same Room with someone

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.280
and be texting to each Other

01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:49.779
Yeah Well There's a There's a piece Of evidence to that supports that to some degree so?

01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:55.960
Women with Brothers are less Likely to Get raped ha and the reason for that is that They've Learned That

01:26:56.659 --> 01:27:01.599
Nonverbal Language Deeply Right and They can They can they can spot the only that i

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:08.889
Have noticed okay in My into my career okay that That Women who have many Brothers They are

01:27:09.619 --> 01:27:11.619
Very Good okay as

01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:16.629
Administrators and As Businesspeople okay all right Because They don't Take men

01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:23.500
Seriously okay They regard They They think they Saw Their brothers They think their brothers are Jokes okay but they know how to control men

01:27:23.699 --> 01:27:24.150
okay

01:27:24.150 --> 01:27:31.319
While It wall-e's to like men okay They admired men right so like This is something that i have seen You know repeatedly Yeah well

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:37.289
So that Would Be also reflective you have the problem of Fewer and Fewer Siblings yes That's right okay yeah yeah?

01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:40.559
I've noticed in publishing okay there's this that the

01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:47.280
There was the Women who have this is the Job of publicists okay and rise to the top as manager of publicity okay Their

01:27:47.349 --> 01:27:51.929
Ability to take Charge of men and and and their humor in men they like that and

01:27:52.599 --> 01:27:55.919
They have Great relationships with men okay Because they don't

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.909
Have the sense of resentment and

01:27:57.909 --> 01:28:04.109
Worry and Anxiety you Know and so They don't see men as aggressors okay right and i think it's another Thing too is that as

01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:05.679
feminism

01:28:05.679 --> 01:28:11.038
You Know moved into its present it's a System of ideology okay it has tended to

01:28:11.170 --> 01:28:16.079
a denigrate Motherhood okay as a lesser order of Human Experience and

01:28:16.179 --> 01:28:19.888
and to enshrine of Course abortion Now i am a Hundred Percent of abortion Rights

01:28:19.959 --> 01:28:23.639
you Know i belong to planned Parenthood for Years Until i Finally Rejected It As a

01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:27.659
Branch Of The democratic Party My own Party and so on but but as

01:28:28.059 --> 01:28:35.969
Motherhood became Excluded as as feminism Became Obsessed okay with the professional Woman okay i feel that the

01:28:36.099 --> 01:28:40.498
Lessons of That mothers Learn Have Been lost okay yeah to to

01:28:41.139 --> 01:28:46.739
feminism and Which is okay that if they if They're the mothers who bear boy Children okay

01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:52.559
Understand The fragility of men the fragility of Boys They Understand It They don't They don't see

01:28:53.079 --> 01:29:00.929
men and Boys as a Menace They understand That The greater strength of Women okay so there's this tenderness you know and connectedness

01:29:00.929 --> 01:29:07.498
Between The between the mother and the boy child okay when motherhood is part of The experience okay of

01:29:08.019 --> 01:29:13.169
Women who are discussing gender so what We Have today is that This Does gender

01:29:13.389 --> 01:29:14.559
Ideology Has Risen Up on

01:29:14.559 --> 01:29:20.699
Campuses where we're all none of the none of the Girls know the students are married none of Them have had Children okay and you?

01:29:20.699 --> 01:29:24.299
Have you have Women some of Whom have had Children but a Lot of They're Lesbians or like or like?

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:31.269
Like professional Women and so on so this this the Whole tenderness and Forgiving Forgiving This okay and?

01:29:32.059 --> 01:29:33.939
Encouragement that Women do to

01:29:33.939 --> 01:29:36.789
Two Boys okay the fragility They don't Understand This

01:29:37.249 --> 01:29:44.769
Hypersensitivity of Boys is not understood okay Instead Boys are seen as somehow now i'm more privileged okay and somehow you know in

01:29:45.019 --> 01:29:47.019
Their Their Their Energy Level Is

01:29:47.539 --> 01:29:52.779
Interpreted as Aggression okay potential Violence and so on okay right so i think that That

01:29:53.959 --> 01:29:59.529
That What we Would do the Better okay iF we Would have i have proposed okay that colleges Should?

01:29:59.809 --> 01:30:01.898
Allow When the moment a Woman is

01:30:02.209 --> 01:30:08.858
Entered okay she has interested at college for life okay and that she that she should be free to

01:30:09.289 --> 01:30:10.039
leave

01:30:10.039 --> 01:30:16.839
Okay to have babies When she would her body Wants That babies When it's Healthy to have them okay and then Return Have Haven't had?

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:21.609
Their occasional Course so can Build Up credits and fathers i Mean You might Be Able to do it as Well and so on

01:30:21.679 --> 01:30:26.949
To get married Women and Women With Children into the classroom the moment that happens

01:30:27.109 --> 01:30:32.889
It's happened after World War two okay we've had you had a Lot of Married you Guys in the classroom okay and so

01:30:32.889 --> 01:30:34.879
I'm not yet That many Women the

01:30:34.879 --> 01:30:41.829
Experience Of a Married person with a Family okay talking about gender But most of the Gender Stuff Will Be Laughed out of the Room

01:30:41.959 --> 01:30:45.429
okay if you had a real mother in there who had Experience in childbirth and

01:30:45.679 --> 01:30:51.279
Head Rate and It Was raising Boys and so on well i think That's That's also a You Know something That

01:30:51.379 --> 01:30:58.629
Has Led to this This This incredible art you Know artificiality and and hysteria okay feminist Rhetoric

01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:07.688
There's an There's another strange Element to that Which iS that on the one hand the The radical feminist Types That?

01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:15.639
Neo-Marxist Post Modernists are are Very Much Opposed to the patriarchy Let's Say and That's that uni-Dimensional

01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:17.239
Ideological

01:31:17.239 --> 01:31:18.889
Representation

01:31:18.889 --> 01:31:23.918
Perhaps The Word could be Applied to a Republican Rome and That's It okay well i mean maybe It could Be Applied

01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:29.320
Usefully to Certain Kinds of Tyranny but not to a society That's Actually Functional Victorian England

01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:36.249
Arguably okay but Other Than that it to use the word patriarchy in that in a Slapdash Way so amateurish

01:31:37.219 --> 01:31:39.728
Actually You Know Just Shows People Know nothing about History

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:43.719
Whatever have You ever Read have done no reading so and so What Confuses me about?

01:31:44.230 --> 01:31:47.739
Is that despite the fact that the patriarchy is viewed as this

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:54.819
essentially Evil Entity and That That's associated with The masculine energy That Built This oppressive structure the

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.369
Antithesis of That Which Would Actually be

01:31:57.890 --> 01:32:03.220
Femininity as far As i can Tell Which is Tightly associated with care and with Child-rearing Is also

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:08.200
Denigrated so it's like the only proper rule for Women to adopt is a

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:12.580
Patriarchal Rule despite The fact that the patriarchy is something That's entirely Corrupt so the

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:18.250
Hypothesis Seems to be that the patriarchy would be Just fine if Women Ran It so

01:32:18.770 --> 01:32:24.220
no changes it's Just that It Would Just be a transformation of Leadership and somehow that Would That Would

01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:31.750
Rectify The Fundamental problem even Though it's hypothetically Supposed to be structural okay so i'm gonna close with something so

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:33.590
you Know

01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:37.779
There are Elements in My Character That are optimistic you know i've

01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:42.609
Looked For Example i worked for a U.N. committee and on the relationship between economic

01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:47.649
Development and sustainability and i found out a Variety of Things That were very optimistic like the fact That

01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:49.330
you Know the U.N. set out

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:54.789
To have Poverty Between 2000 and 2015 worldwide and Actually Hit that By about?

01:32:55.100 --> 01:33:02.079
2010 right so we're in that period of the fastest transformation of The bottom strata of the World's population into something approximating

01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:09.970
Middle Class That's ever occurred and There's all These Great Technological innovations on the horizon and and It Looks to me like Things could Go

01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:14.229
Extraordinarily Well If we Were Careful but I'm not Optimistic and

01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:20.200
Maybe That'S me i'm pessimistic because i also see that There's five or six Things happening all of Which

01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:22.400
Appear at the level of

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:27.160
Catastrophe that are all happening at The same time and so One of The things that i'd like to ask you is like

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.979
What do you see happening in the next 10 Years

01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:34.540
In in the universities or in culture at large and i Mean You Just Put Forward a proposal?

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:37.539
For The Universities for The treatment of Women Which i think is a Very interesting

01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:44.079
One Because Women do have a different Timeframe Than men but like What the hell is the proper way Forward i've Been

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:51.100
Encouraging Young men to tell the truth and to take responsibility and There's a Huge Market for that message but but i'm not

01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:54.609
Convinced By Any Stretch of the imagination that it's enough

01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:59.679
What like when you look Forward You Try to be optimistic What the hell do you see

01:34:00.109 --> 01:34:03.369
Well and in the largest you know scale

01:34:04.010 --> 01:34:06.010
I'm concerned about the future

01:34:06.739 --> 01:34:08.719
Western culture Because

01:34:08.719 --> 01:34:14.138
As a Student of History It Looks, too much to me like ancient Rome okay which became Over Expanded

01:34:14.809 --> 01:34:18.099
Which became a It Was at The Mercy of a Bureaucratic

01:34:20.449 --> 01:34:22.449
Creep okay and

01:34:24.379 --> 01:34:28.869
and in the and roman identity eventually

01:34:29.269 --> 01:34:35.409
Got Blurred okay in its incorporation of so Many different cultures Which i first seems Like a Healthy Kind of

01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:39.969
multiculturalism But Eventually Over Expand and Simply Collapse of Its own Way but iii

01:34:40.489 --> 01:34:47.168
So i am concerned about the you know whether western culture is in a rapid decline i think It Would Be Very

01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:53.079
Easy Because We Are you know so interconnected and so Over complex Very easy you know to bring it to

01:34:53.269 --> 01:34:57.159
Ruin It Would Only Take One Major Natural disaster you know to do that

01:34:57.409 --> 01:35:03.038
But The Universities Themselves i Mean i think People are all of a Sudden in the united States much more

01:35:03.769 --> 01:35:06.219
attentive to issues of political Correctness

01:35:06.289 --> 01:35:12.608
Because of The the riots At Berkeley Which was the you know Which was the capital of free speech i mean i don't Mean the the

01:35:12.609 --> 01:35:14.609
Free speech movement Happened in the spring?

01:35:14.989 --> 01:35:19.328
before i entered college in 1964 It so one of the Great principles and

01:35:19.879 --> 01:35:23.019
Inspirational Stories of My entire Life Mario Savio is you know you know

01:35:24.469 --> 01:35:29.768
Assertion of The of The Supremacy of you know free thought and free speech these okay and i

01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:31.550
so i think that Perhaps

01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:37.209
You Know we might Just Have Turned a corner and but it's gonna take a Very Very long time for the university to be Reformed

01:35:37.209 --> 01:35:44.529
I feel that the cafeteria menu okay of the university curriculum has to be abandoned we Must return to

01:35:45.079 --> 01:35:46.519
Historical

01:35:46.519 --> 01:35:50.349
Courses That Begin in the earliest period in the stone age

01:35:50.409 --> 01:35:56.199
In Antiquity in order to give perspective you know to to our to our present to an analysis of a person a culture i want

01:35:57.379 --> 01:36:03.489
50 50 to 75 percent of college Administrators Fired okay and the Money Be Transferred over okay to

01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:11.290
to to faculty into libraries into into instruction okay i i think that you know the obviously the

01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:16.299
Way Things are being People are being a trained Right Now including at The public School Level okay

01:36:16.449 --> 01:36:17.600
Is i think that writing the public School Level has gone to hell, when

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:21.339
my mother came you know came

01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:28.299
To united States The age of six they Would the old public School System Was still Very strict and therefore if she had some excellent

01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:34.029
Education You Know it's a and you know didn't Got all a'S and in her in her and even though she

01:36:34.190 --> 01:36:37.719
Started out Not speaking english Spoke without an accent etc okay so

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:44.560
Today This This Kind of Feel-good The public school Education Which is Which is a form of ideology and

01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:52.449
Indoctrination Right Now it'S all about no bullying okay and not about you not even seriously about no bullying Yes i

01:36:52.969 --> 01:36:58.089
Can Tell in My own Students i Mean i've Been teaching for 46 Years so i can tell this slow Degradation

01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:04.810
Of Public School Education Get Today to the point now that the students have absolutely no sense of World Geography

01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:09.340
of World History okay they know absolutely don't Know anything about Wars okay

01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:11.860
and The Reality The

01:37:12.409 --> 01:37:18.519
Barbaric Reality of Most of Human History and What It Whatever defense That's Triggering yes right What a fantastic

01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:24.669
culture we live in and so you know it didn't identity Politics itself has Just got to stop i mean It Was important once okay

01:37:24.679 --> 01:37:28.329
Again i i was a Rebel Against The the wasp you know

01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:36.279
Hegemony okay White anglo-Saxon protestant hegemony in American culture it Was It Was suffocating iii Was raised in the 1950s

01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:38.830
When Wasps Controlled

01:37:39.230 --> 01:37:46.689
Corporations and and and Education and Politics and so on it so identity Politics Was Necessary once okay to it we

01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:51.610
Asserted getting gay Rights okay with it with stonewall rebellion Of 1969 We assert we

01:37:51.770 --> 01:37:59.409
Asserted okay the Women's rights with ii with the with the rebirth of Second wave feminism in the late 1960s okay but This Endless okay

01:37:59.870 --> 01:38:01.340
preoccupation with with a

01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:08.290
Fragmented Identity We Must Return to be authentic Nineteen Sixties Vision Which is about identity coming from consciousness Which

01:38:08.690 --> 01:38:10.690
Transcends Gender Which

01:38:10.969 --> 01:38:17.829
Transcends all These divisions of Race okay and the ethnicity okay consciousness itself okay right

01:38:18.469 --> 01:38:24.959
There's no sense of That Any longer and That's What the 1960s sought well i see if that is a complete abandonment of personal responsibility

01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.580
Because That Like That

01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:28.660
Consciousness i think

01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:33.960
symbolically and i Got a Lot of This from Jung and also from Eric Neumann i Mean That's the Great logos of the west right

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:36.059
That's the Transcendent principle Which is is

01:38:36.850 --> 01:38:38.850
Respect For the Primacy of

01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:45.900
Individual Consciousness and What Goes Along with that primarily isn't individual Rights although That's built into it i mean That's the reason we have?

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.629
Individual Rights Is for respect for that but the

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:55.199
responsibility That Comes Along With being an individual Instead of The member of some Group especially a Victimized Group Which is like

01:38:55.450 --> 01:39:00.929
sure i wrote an article with One of My Students Who had toured the mass grave sites in in the former

01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:05.639
Yugoslavia You Know What Haven't Been Exposed to that sort of Thing and one of The things that our

01:39:05.890 --> 01:39:09.690
research indicated Was that The best predictor of Genocide is

01:39:10.450 --> 01:39:11.890
victimization on the part of the Group That

01:39:11.890 --> 01:39:17.910
Produces The Genocide right a sense of an accelerated sense of victimization and then it's well We Get them before They Get us

01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:22.230
So and Everyone's being taught Now that They're a victim and then no one Seems

01:39:22.230 --> 01:39:28.409
To have Any sense That You Know That's part of The essential tragedy of Being That life is suffering and that and That?

01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:35.730
and That and and that The World rests on a Foundation of Suffering it's nothing to take personally and something to take

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:41.010
responsibility for Instead of Blaming and and resentment and all of The Things that Have polluted our

01:39:41.230 --> 01:39:49.139
Universities and Our culture well and There also Was the abandonment okay of the you know of the canon okay People you know

01:39:49.630 --> 01:39:53.759
Asserted That The Canon Was the product of bias and again of You know of

01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:55.450
a you know

01:39:55.450 --> 01:40:00.840
provincial Elitism and so on but in in point of fact as a Student of History of The arts okay i can i can

01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:08.579
assure People That the Canon okay oh the overwhelmingly so is is the result of What artists have determined okay we

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:12.570
Say a Work is important as canonical Because

01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:18.210
Artists Following It okay we're Influenced by It we Have This like a Beautiful Cascading tradition of

01:40:18.730 --> 01:40:23.639
Influence Alright So that That's another but not another part of the philistine ism okay of

01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:27.690
Current Education to you know to believe That there are these external

01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:32.159
Reasons okay for for That Why a Work last Why a Work you know

01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:35.050
500 Years Ago or a Thousand Years Ago has global relevance

01:40:36.050 --> 01:40:38.050
relevance As iF it'S some sort of Political

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:44.019
Conspiracy That's Based on power as if anybody could Even manage that no matter how nefarious they were

01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:46.160
but Also

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:53.380
We in the 60s even Hadn't had the idea okay then there Was like This Human Human Sensibility like That Transcendent?

01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:57.640
Individual if The Nation's and and so on right and that and That

01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:02.980
There was This Like Rubric for Cosmic consciousness okay and this This

01:41:03.170 --> 01:41:08.920
Sense of the universe as a Whole and Just to see the Human being in relationship to great eternal

01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:14.920
Principles of life into Death Mortality and so on Whereas you know Marxism is blind

01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:17.709
Marxism Is Very Narrow All It sees Is a

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:24.220
Society okay It sees nothing Beyond Society It Doesn't Seem nature okay it's absolutely Mad

01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:31.300
How you can Have a System being taught okay in universities right Which It which thinks that This tiny Thing of

01:41:31.490 --> 01:41:36.849
Society okay compared to the Enormity and Beauty of nature okay should take all of our

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:42.729
All of our you know absorb all of Our energy and Attention so i mean i Just think that There's like a Parochialism and

01:41:43.250 --> 01:41:44.720
provincialism

01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:46.220
you Know it

01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:48.220
Now a Kind of you know

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:54.160
Systematized Elitism in our Current Education has Got to be Rooted Out and we i want

01:41:54.160 --> 01:42:01.749
To return to basics great Simplicity side all these Faculty members teaching Their little Tiny Courses that have to has to do with Their own?

01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:08.979
Specialty That's Got to stop okay People People can Even pursue whatever They want in their private research as Scholars okay Certainly That's Necessary

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.229
But They must teach in the core curriculum

01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:13.820
and and and

01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:20.889
People Must decide What is Crucial for an educated person to know i do want a multicultural i do want a Global Curriculum i want

01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:28.570
I what all the cultures taught okay right This is not the answer Martin Marxism this neo Marxism in the universities okay is

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.530
Simply It's lazy It's a lazy Way to assert

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:37.059
multiculturalism Without Actually Doing The research of The Study of Other cultures

01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:42.969
Okay all right That's a Good one to close one we Agreed on everything?

01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:46.380
yes i know it oh Great
