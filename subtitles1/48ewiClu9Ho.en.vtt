00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.969
It's not all that

00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:03.479
happens though when they eat the fruit of the tree of

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:07.949
The knowledge of good and evil because it's not called the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of nakedness

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.069
It's called the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.950
And I thought about that for a tremendous amount of time

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.619
It's like what in the world because I assumed these old stories make sense. You know, it's a game

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.319
I play it's like they're old. They've been around a long time. I'm not sure why they're there, but there they are

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.739
they're at the basis of our culture like

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.619
many many of the stories that we depend on depend on them our whole culture grew out of their

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.950
Roots, let's say and so I assume that our ancestors who managed to survive conditions

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.290
That would have done a lot of us in very rapidly

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.700
I can tell you we're a lot smarter than we think and that the mysterious

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.460
Processes that that produce these stories and compelled us to remember them are a lot more

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.669
Psychologically significant than we generally tend to presume

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.070
So I give them the benefit of the doubt and try to understand why it is that they might make sense

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.849
Instead of assuming that they don't and that that's not easy

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.349
As their complicated stories and so I thought about this nakedness

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.379
Knowledge of good and evil idea for a very very long time like about 20 years

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.659
Puzzling it out. What the hell is the relationship between discovering that you're naked and

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.810
discovering good and evil and then one day

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.139
mostly because of studying totalitarianism

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.000
Totalitarianism and the atrocity that proclivity for people to commit atrocity in the service of their group belief

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.820
Or maybe just because that's what they were like

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.499
Clued me in and I thought I see this is one of the things that really makes people different than animals

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.939
It's like, you know

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.969
It's one thing to realize that you're naked to realize that you're naked means that you know that you're limited in time and space

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.979
That you're mortal and that you're subject to degeneration and to social

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.339
Humiliation and to your own harsh judgement all of that nakedness to know that you're vulnerable

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.378
Against the world and definitely a source of shame because of that

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:11.980
and

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.179
and a felt lack of self-sufficiency and then no wonder and no wonder

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.450
it's understandable, but the other thing is is that

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.970
This is and this is the rub

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.110
it's like if you're out in the veldt and you're not being very careful and a hungry lion jumps on you and

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.069
Eats you you don't really think of the lion as evil. I mean you might right at that moment, but you know

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.409
Philosophically, it's not evil. It's just hungry and as soon as it's not hungry then

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.789
It goes and has asleep and it's not up to some malevolent trick. It's it's done for the day but

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:57.160
Human being that's a whole different sort of creature. And because human being is capable of doing terrible things to someone else and

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:04.719
Consciously, so you think well, what's the connection between that and nakedness itself? And it seems to be this is like

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.849
Here's the thing is that once I realize that I can be hurt, you know, I have a self conscious model of my own

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.900
vulnerability

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.819
Then I can generalize that to other people I can think. Oh, this is interesting

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.828
Here's how I can be heard by myself. Here's how I can be heard by society

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.370
Here's how I can be hurt by nature and by the unknown and what that implies is that well you can be hurt

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.579
with exactly the same mechanisms and

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.479
that in need immediately becomes part of my

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.840
what would you say my repertoire of ability and then all of a sudden the world is no longer a walled a

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:55.238
Walled garden and a well watered place, but it's a moral story because with that ability to inflict

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:56.870
suffering

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.630
Comes the knowledge of good and evil as far as I'm concerned those are identical

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:09.488
Propositions because now we have the choice a deep choice about how we're going to treat ourselves and each other we can inflict

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.239
tremendous pain and suffering on each other in a very

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.510
voluntary and and

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.650
conscious manner in

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:26.030
a way that no other animal can manage and that's the dawning of the moral sense that

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.960
capacity we now have to choose to

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.919
Mitigate or exaggerate suffering and and that's not all but it's a huge part of it
