00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
take a chance aim at that work at it and
 

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.030 align:start position:0%
take a chance aim at that work at it and
see<00:12:39.200><c> what</c><00:12:39.440><c> happens</c>

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
see what happens
 

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.910 align:start position:0%
see what happens
so

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.670 align:start position:0%
so
so<00:12:42.079><c> that's</c><00:12:42.480><c> and</c><00:12:42.560><c> that's</c><00:12:42.800><c> a</c><00:12:42.880><c> disciplinary</c>

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
so that's and that's a disciplinary
 

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.829 align:start position:0%
so that's and that's a disciplinary
routine<00:12:44.320><c> i</c><00:12:44.480><c> would</c><00:12:44.720><c> say</c><00:12:45.120><c> yeah</c><00:12:45.360><c> and</c><00:12:45.519><c> it</c><00:12:45.600><c> takes</c>

look every ideal is a judge
 

00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:05.510 align:start position:0%
look every ideal is a judge
right<00:42:03.920><c> so</c><00:42:04.160><c> you</c><00:42:04.400><c> pause</c><00:42:04.640><c> it</c><00:42:04.800><c> an</c><00:42:04.960><c> ideal</c><00:42:05.359><c> and</c>

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
right so you pause it an ideal and
 

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.510 align:start position:0%
right so you pause it an ideal and

00:42:09.359 --> 00:42:10.630 align:start position:0%

okay<00:42:10.960><c> so</c><00:42:11.119><c> what</c><00:42:11.280><c> do</c><00:42:11.359><c> you</c><00:42:11.599><c> do</c><00:42:11.839><c> about</c><00:42:12.079><c> that</c><00:42:12.240><c> well</c>

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay so what do you do about that well
 

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.430 align:start position:0%
okay so what do you do about that well
one<00:42:12.640><c> answer</c><00:42:12.960><c> is</c><00:42:13.359><c> no</c><00:42:13.680><c> ideals</c><00:42:14.880><c> well</c><00:42:15.040><c> that's</c><00:42:15.280><c> not</c>

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
one answer is no ideals well that's not
 

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.710 align:start position:0%
one answer is no ideals well that's not
a<00:42:15.520><c> good</c><00:42:15.760><c> answer</c><00:42:16.079><c> because</c><00:42:16.240><c> then</c><00:42:16.480><c> you</c><00:42:16.560><c> don't</c>

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
a good answer because then you don't
 

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.710 align:start position:0%
a good answer because then you don't
have<00:42:16.880><c> anything</c><00:42:17.280><c> to</c><00:42:17.440><c> do</c>

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
have anything to do
 

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.430 align:start position:0%
have anything to do
right<00:42:19.119><c> so</c><00:42:19.680><c> so</c><00:42:20.240><c> and</c><00:42:20.400><c> that</c><00:42:20.640><c> deprives</c><00:42:21.119><c> you</c><00:42:21.280><c> of</c><00:42:21.359><c> a</c>

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
right so so and that deprives you of a
 

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.349 align:start position:0%

powerful potential kick there so you
 

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.470 align:start position:0%
powerful potential kick there so you

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
what's the next step or they say geez
 

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.069 align:start position:0%
what's the next step or they say geez
you<00:45:25.520><c> know</c><00:45:25.680><c> i</c><00:45:25.920><c> just</c><00:45:26.240><c> kept</c><00:45:26.560><c> avoiding</c><00:45:27.040><c> that</c>

00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
you know i just kept avoiding that
 

00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:30.390 align:start position:0%
you know i just kept avoiding that
and<00:45:28.160><c> then</c><00:45:28.400><c> you</c><00:45:28.560><c> say</c><00:45:28.800><c> okay</c><00:45:29.119><c> well</c>

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
and then you say okay well
 

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.270 align:start position:0%
and then you say okay well
we<00:45:30.640><c> need</c><00:45:30.800><c> to</c><00:45:30.960><c> break</c><00:45:31.280><c> that</c><00:45:31.599><c> down</c>

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
we need to break that down
 

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.230 align:start position:0%
we need to break that down
you<00:45:33.520><c> avoided</c><00:45:34.000><c> it</c><00:45:34.319><c> well</c><00:45:34.800><c> could</c><00:45:35.040><c> you</c><00:45:35.359><c> write</c><00:45:35.839><c> one</c>

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
you avoided it well could you write one
 

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.150 align:start position:0%
you avoided it well could you write one

you you can have whatever ideal you want
 

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.550 align:start position:0%
you you can have whatever ideal you want

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
as long as you're willing
 

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.030 align:start position:0%
as long as you're willing
to<00:46:33.200><c> reduce</c><00:46:33.760><c> your</c><00:46:33.920><c> movement</c><00:46:34.240><c> forward</c><00:46:34.640><c> to</c>

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
to reduce your movement forward to
 

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.109 align:start position:0%
to reduce your movement forward to
achievable<00:46:35.520><c> increments</c><00:46:36.400><c> but</c><00:46:36.560><c> that's</c><00:46:36.800><c> okay</c>

00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
achievable increments but that's okay
 

00:46:37.119 --> 00:46:38.069 align:start position:0%
achievable increments but that's okay
because

00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
because
 

00:46:38.079 --> 00:46:40.309 align:start position:0%
because
they<00:46:38.319><c> compound</c>

00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
they compound
 

00:46:40.319 --> 00:46:42.150 align:start position:0%
they compound
so<00:46:40.880><c> and</c><00:46:41.200><c> i</c><00:46:41.280><c> really</c><00:46:41.520><c> learned</c><00:46:41.760><c> this</c><00:46:42.000><c> as</c><00:46:42.079><c> a</c>
