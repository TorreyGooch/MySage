[CLASSICAL MUSIC]

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:29.020
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.300
Well, thank you all very much for coming to this.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.900
It's really shocking to me that you don't have anything better to do on a Tuesday night. [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.960
No, but seriously, though, it is.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:52.240
I mean, it's very strange in some sense that there's so many of you here to listen to a sequence of lectures on the psychological significance of the Biblical stories.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:02.120
It's something I've wanted to do for a long time, but it still does surprise me that there's a ready audience for it.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.440
So that's good, so we'll see how it goes.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.280
I'll start with this because this is the right question.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.720
The right question is why bother doing this.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.380
And I don't mean why should I bother doing it.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.740
I have my own reasons for doing it, but you might think, well, why bother with this strange, old book at all?

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.000
And...

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.480
That's a good question.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.260
You know,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.980
Umm

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.340
It's a contradictory...

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.300
document that's been cobbled together over thousands of years.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.900
It's outlasted kingdoms, many,  many kingdoms, you know?

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.040
It's very interesting, it turns out that a book is more durable than stone.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.540
It's more durable than a castle.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.060
It's more durable than an empire.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.560
And that's really interesting.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.380
That something, in some sense, so evanescent, can be so long living.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.920
So there's that, that's kind of a mystery.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.660
I'm approaching this whole scenario, this Biblical stories as if they're a mystery, fundamentally.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.040
Because they are, there's a lot we don't understand about them.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.800
We don't understand how they came about. We don't really understand how they were put together.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.420
We don't understand why they had such an unbelievable impact on civilization.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.600
We don't understand how people could have believed them.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.520
We don't understand what it means that we don't believe them now, or even what it would mean if we did believe them.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:44.780
And then, on top of all that, there's the additional problem, which isn't specific to me, but is certainly relevant to me,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.940
that no matter how educated you are, you're not educated enough to discuss the psychological significance of the Biblical stories.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.080
But I'm going to do my best.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:05.860
Partly because I want to learn more about them, and one of the things I've learned is that the best way to learn about something is to talk about it.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.020
And when I'm lecturing, I'm thinking, you know, I'm not trying to tell you what I know for sure to be the case.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.380
Because there's lots of things I don't know for sure to be the case.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.600
I'm trying to make sense out of this.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.920
And I have been doing this for a long time.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.600
Now, you may know, you may not,

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.260
that I'm an admirer of Nietzsche.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.560
Nietzsche was a devastating critic of, I would say, dogmatic Christianity.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.280
Christianity as it was instantiated in institutions.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.900
I suppose... although he's a very paradoxical thinker.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.680
For example, one of the things Nietzsche said was that he didn't believe that the scientific revolution would have ever got off the ground

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.100
if it hadn't been for Christianity.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.200
And more specifically, for Catholicism because he believed that over the course of, really, a thousand years,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:11.700
the European mind, so to speak, had to train itself to interpret everything that was known within a single, coherent framework.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.660
Coherent if you accept the initial axioms.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.680
A single coherent framework.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:30.700
So Nietzsche believed that that Catholicization of the phenomena of life and of history produced the kind of mind that was then capable of transcending its dogmatic foundations

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.740
and then concentrating on something else.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.780
Which, in this particular case, happened to be the natural world.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:46.820
And so Nietzsche believed that, in some sense, that Christianity died at its own hand that spent a very long period of time trying to attune people to the necessity of the truth.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.220
Absent corruption and all of that, that's always part of any human endeavor.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.900
And then the truth, the spirit of the truth that was developed by Christianity turned on the roots of Christianity.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.700
And everyone woke up and said or thought something like, "Well how is it that we came to believe any of this?"

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.220
It's like waking up one day and noting that you really don't know why you put the Christmas tree up.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.880
You'd been doing it for a long time, and that's what people do, you know, and there are reasons that Christmas trees came about.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:25.160
But the ritual lasts long after the reasons have been forgotten.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:38.160
So, now Nietzsche, although he was a critic of Christianity, and also a champion of its disciplinary capacity, because you see, the other thing that Nietzsche believed was

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:44.280
it's not possible to be free, in some sense, unless you have been a slave.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:51.440
By that he meant that you don't go from childhood to full-fledged adult individuality.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:58.180
You go from childhood to a state of discipline, which you might think is akin to slavery,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:06.640
to self-imposed slavery, that would be the best scenario, where you have to discipline yourself to become something specific,

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.820
before you might be able to re-attain the generality that you had as a child.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.180
And he believed that Christianity had played that role for Western civilization.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.800
But, in the late 1800s, he announced that God was dead.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.380
And you often hear of that as something triumphant.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.780
But for Nietzsche, it wasn't because he was too nuanced a thinker to be that simple-minded.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.140
See, Nietzsche understood that, this is something I'm going to try to make clear, is that

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.780
there's a very large amount that we don't know about the structure of experience, that we don't know about reality.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:59.940
And we have our articulated representations of the world, and then you can think of outside of that: there are things we know absolutely nothing about.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.920
And there's a buffer between them.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.600
And those are things we sort of know something about.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.020
We don't know them in an articulated way, here's an example.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.640
You know sometimes you're arguing with someone close to you and they're in a bad mood, you know?

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.960
And they're being touchy and unreasonable and you keep the conversation up.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.520
And maybe all of the sudden they get angry, or maybe they cry.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:28.620
And then when they cry, they figure out what they're angry about and it has nothing to do with you, even though you might have been what precipitated the argument.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:37.740
And that's an interesting phenomena as far as I'm concerned, because it means that people can know things at one level without being able to speak what they know at another.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:44.940
So in some sense, the thoughts rise up from the body, and they do that in moods, and they do that in images, and they do that in actions.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:51.980
And we have all sorts of ways that we understand before we understand in a fully articulated manner.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:08:00.400
So we have this articulated space that we can all discuss and then outside of that we have something that is more akin to a dream that we're embedded in.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.040
It's an emotional dream that we're embedded in.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.560
That's based, at least in part, on our actions, I'll describe that later.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.600
And then outside of that is what we don't know anything about at all.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.600
And in that dream, that's where the mystics live, and that's where the artists live.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.580
And they're the mediators between the absolute unknown and the things we know for sure.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:30.480
You see, what that means in some sense is what we know is established on a form of knowledge that we don't really understand.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:36.700
And that if those two things are out of sync, so you might say if our articulated knowledge is out of sync with our dream,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.080
then we become dissociated internally.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.320
We think things we don't act out and we act out things we don't dream.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.640
And that produces a kind of sickness of the spirit.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:57.800
And that sickness of the spirit, its cure is something like an integrated system of belief and representation.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:04.200
And then people turn to things like ideologies, which I regard as parasites on an underlying religious substructure

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.700
to try to organize their thinking, and then that's a catastrophe.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.020
And that's what Nietzsche foresaw.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:19.420
You see, he knew that when we knocked the slats out of the base of Western civilization by destroying this representation, this "god ideal," let's say,

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:26.480
that we would destabilize and move back and forth violently between nihilism and the extremes of ideology.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.160
He was particularly concerned about radical left ideology.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:38.020
He believed and predicted this in the late eighteen hundreds, which is really an absolute intellectual tour-de-force of staggering magnitude.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:44.560
He predicted that in the twentieth century that hundreds of millions of people would die because of the replacement of these

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:52.580
underlying dreamlike structures with this rational but deeply incorrect representation of the world.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:57.920
And we've been oscillating back and forth between left and right, in some sense, ever since,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.460
with some good sprinkling of nihilism in there, and despair.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:09.040
In some sense, that's the situation of the modern Western person and increasingly, of people in general.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:18.300
You know, I think part of the reason that Islam has its back up, with regards to the West to such a degree, I mean there's many reasons, and not all of them are valid, that's for sure,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:32.740
but one of the reasons is that they, being still grounded in a dream, let's say, they can see that the rootless questioning mind of the West poses a tremendous danger to the integrity of their culture.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:39.580
And it does, I mean, Westerners, us, we undermine ourselves all the time with our searching intellect.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.160
And I'm not complaining about that.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.200
There isn't anything easy that can be done about it.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:52.140
But it's still a sort of fruitful catastrophe.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.100
And it has real effects on people's lives.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.120
It's not some abstract thing.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:05.200
Lots of times, when I've been treating people with depression, for example, or anxiety, they have existential issues, you know?

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.200
It's not just some psychiatric condition.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:14.900
It's not just that they're tapped off of normal because their brain chemistry is faulty, although sometimes that happens to be the case.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:23.380
It's that they are overwhelmed by the suffering and complexity of their life and they're not sure why it's reasonable to continue with it.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:31.500
They can feel the terrible negative meanings of life, but are skeptical beyond belief about any of the positive meanings.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.640
I had one client who's a very brilliant artist and as long as he didn't think he was fine.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.460
Because he'd go and create, and he was really good at being an artist.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:47.040
He had that personality that was continually creative and quite brilliant, although he was self-denigrating.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:59.400
But as soon as he started to think about what he was doing, then, it's like a drill or a saw, he'd saw the branch off that he was sitting on.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:05.600
He'd start to criticize what he was doing, even the utility of it, even though it was sort of self-evidently useful.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.220
And then it would be very, very hard for him to even motivate himself to create.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:23.260
He alway struck me as a good example of the consequences of having your rational intellect divorced in some way from your being.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.800
Divorced enough that it actually questions the utility of your being.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.740
And it's not a good thing, it's not a good thing.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:39.560
It's really not a good thing because it manifests itself not only in individual psychopathology, but also in social psychopathology,

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:49.480
and that's this proclivity of people to get tangled up in ideologies, which I really do think of, they're like crippled religions, that's the right way to think about them.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.300
They're like religion that's missing an arm and a leg but can still hobble along.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:59.760
And it provides a certain amount of security and group identity, but it's warped and twisted and demented and bent.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.620
And it's a parasite on something underlying that's rich and true.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.380
That's how it looks to me, anyways.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:11.660
So I think it's very important that we sort out this problem.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:17.220
I think that there isn't anything more important that needs to be done that.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.500
I've thought that for a long, long time.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.300
Probably since the early eighties,

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:31.520
when I started looking at the role that belief systems played in regulating psychological and social health.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:38.880
You can tell that they do that because of how upset people get if you challenge their belief systems.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.960
It's like, why the hell do they care, exactly?

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:47.580
What difference does it make if all of your ideological axioms are 100% correct?

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:52.420
People get unbelievably upset when you poke them in the axioms, so to speak.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:52.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.940
And it is not by any stretch of the imagination obvious why.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:03.580
But there's some, it's like there's a fundamental truth that they're standing on.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.640
It's like they're on a raft in the middle of the ocean and you're starting to pull out the logs.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.040
They're afraid they're going to fall in and drown.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.960
It's like, drown in what?

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.460
What are the logs protecting them from?

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.980
Why are they so afraid to move beyond the confines of the ideological system?

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.220
These are not obvious things.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.760
So, I've been trying to puzzle that out for a very long time.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.400
I've done some lectures about that are on Youtube; most of you know that.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.960
Some of what I'm going to talk about in this series you'll have heard, if you've listened to the Youtube videos.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.360
You know, I'm trying to hit it from different angles.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:47.840
So Nietzsche's idea was that human beings were going to have to create their own values, essentially.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.760
Now he understood that we understood that we have bodies and we have motivations and emotions.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:15:02.880
Like, he was a romantic thinker, in some sense, but way ahead of his time because he knew that our capacity to think wasn't some free-floating soul but was embedded in our physiology,

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.860
constrained by our emotions, shaped by our motivations, shaped by our body.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.800
He understood that.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:18.340
But he still believed that the only possible way out of the problem would be for human beings themselves to become something akin to God and to create their own values.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:25.380
And he thought about the person who creates their own values as the over-man or the super-man.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:35.500
And that was one of the parts of Nietzschian philosophy that the Nazis, I would say, took out of context and used to fuel their superior man ideology.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.700
And we know what happened with that.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.780
That didn't seem to turn out very well, that's for sure.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.880
I also spent a lot of time reading Carl Jung.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:55.180
It was through Jung and also Jean Piaget, who was a developmental psychologist, that I started to understand that our articulated systems of thought

00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:02.520
are embedded in something like a dream and that that dream was informed, in a complex way, by the way we act.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.160
We act out things we don't understand all the time.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.980
If that wasn't the case, then we wouldn't need a psychology or a sociology or an anthropology or any of that

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.360
because we would be completely transparent to ourselves.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.720
And we're clearly not.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:25.160
So, we're much more complicated than we understand, which means that the way that we behave contains way more information than we know.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:33.840
And part of the dream that surrounds our articulated knowledge is being extracted as a consequence of us watching each other behave

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.680
and telling stories about it for thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.520
Extracting out patterns of behavior that characterize humanity.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:50.060
And trying to represent them, partly through imitation, but also drama and mythology and literature and art and all of that.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.080
To represent what we're like so we can understand what we're like.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.660
That process of understanding is what I see unfolding, at least in part, in the Biblical stories.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:07.300
And it's halting and partial and awkward and contradictory and all of that, which is one of the things that makes the book so complex.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:17.700
But I see in it a struggle of humanity to rise above its animal forebears, say, and to become conscious of what it means to be human.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.760
And that's a very difficult thing because we don't know who we are or what we are or where we came from or any of those things.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:28.560
The light life is an unbroken chain going back three and a half billion years.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.200
It's an absolutely unbelievable thing.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:35.780
Every single one of your ancestors reproduced successfully for three and a half billion years.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.920
It's absolutely unbelievable.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:43.600
We rose out of the dirt and the muck and here we are, conscious, but not knowing.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.760
And we're trying to figure out who we are.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:53.100
A story, or several stories, that we've been telling for three thousand years seems to me to have something to offer.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:18:00.280
And so, when I look at the stories in the Bible, I do it, I would say, in some sense with the beginner's mind.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.080
It's a mystery, this book.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:11.180
How the hell it was made, why it was made, why we preserved it, how it happened to motivate an entire culture for two thousand years, and to transform the world.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.420
What's going on? How did that happen?

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:21.860
It's by no means obvious, and one of the things that bothers me about casual critics of religion is that they don't take the phenomena seriously.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.320
And it's a serious phenomena.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.240
Not least because people have the capacity for religious experience, and no one know why that is.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.420
I mean, you can induce it reliably, in all sorts of different ways.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.520
You can do it with brain stimulation.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.160
You can certainly do it with drugs.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:43.120
There's, especially the psychedelic variety, they produce intimations of the divine extraordinarily regularly.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:49.160
People have been using drugs like that for God only knows how long, fifty thousand years, maybe more than that,

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.080
to produce some sort of intimate union with the divine.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.420
We don't understand any of that when we discovered the psychedelics in the late sixties.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:03.860
It shocked everybody so badly that they were instantly made illegal and abandoned, in terms of research, for like fifty years.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.380
And it's no wonder, because who the hell expected that?

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.400
Nobody.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:10.820
Now,

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:19.640
now Jung was a student of Nietzsche's, you see, and he was also, I would say, a very astute critic of Nietzsche.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.700
He was educated by Freud, and Freud

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:32.360
Freud, I suppose, in some sense, started to collate the information that we had pertaining to the notion that people lived inside a dream.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.720
You know, it was Freud who really popularized the idea of the unconscious mind.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:42.860
We take this for granted to such a degree today that we don't understand how revolutionary the idea was.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:50.020
But what's happened with Freud is that we've taken all the marrow out of his bones, so to speak, and left the husk behind.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:55.620
And now when we think about Freud, we just think about the husk because that's everything that's been discarded.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:05.600
But so much of what he discovered is part of our popular conception now, including the idea that your perceptions and your actions and your thoughts are all, what would you say,

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:11.720
informed and shaped by unconscious motivations that are not part of your voluntary control.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.500
And that's a very, very strange thing.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.160
It's one of the most unsettling things about the psychoanalytic theories

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:27.300
is the psychoanalytic theories are something like, you're a loose collection of living sub-personalities, each with its own set of motivations and perceptions

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.860
and emotions and rationales, all of that.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:38.840
And you have limited control over that, so you're like a plurality of internal personalities that's loosely linked into a unity.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:47.520
And you know that because you can't control yourself very well, which is one of Jung's objections to Nietzsche's idea that we can create our own values is that

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.400
is that Jung didn't believe that, especially not after interacting with Freud.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:58.600
Because he saw that human beings were affected by things that were- deeply, deeply affected by things that were beyond their conscious control.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.600
An no one really knows how to conceptualize those things.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.380
The cognitive psychologists think about them in some sense as computational machines.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.740
The ancient people, I think, thought of them as gods, although it's more complex than that.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:16.880
Like rage would be a god. Mars, the god of rage, that's the thing that possesses you when you're angry.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.120
It has a viewpoint, it says what it wants to say.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.640
And that might have very little to do with what you want to say when you're being sensible.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.560
And it doesn't just inhabit you, it inhabits everyone.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.940
And it lives forever, and it even inhabits animals.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:40.740
So it's this transcendent psychological entity that inhabits the body politic, like a thought inhabits the brain.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.280
That's one way of thinking about it.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.780
A very strange way of thinking, but it certainly has its merits.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.820
And so in some sense, those are deities, although it's not that simple.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:59.820
And so Jung got very interested in dreams and started to understand the relationship between dreams and myths.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:06.740
Because he would see in his clients' dreams echoes of stories that he knew because he was deeply read in mythology.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:17.780
And then he started to believe that the dream was the birthplace of the myth and that there was a continual interaction between the two processes, the dream and the story, and storytelling.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.580
Well, you know, you tend to tell your dreams as stories when you remember them.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.000
Some people remember dreams all the time, like two or three a night.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.540
I've had clients like that.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:30.280
They often have archetypal dreams that have very clear mythological structures.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:36.280
I think that's more the case with people who are creative, by the way, especially if they're a bit unstable, at the time.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:46.160
Because the dream tends to occupy the space of uncertainty and to concentrate on fleshing out the unknown reality before you get a real grip on it.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.620
So it's like the dream is the birthplace of thinking, that's a good way of thinking about it.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.020
So because it's the birthplace of thinking, it's not that clear.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.340
It's doing its best to formulate something. That was Jung's notion,

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.480
as opposed to Freud, who believed that there were sensors, internal sensors that were hiding the dream's true message.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:15.440
That's not what Jung believed, he believed the dream was doing its best to express a reality that was still outside of fully articulated conscious comprehension.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:22.080
Because you think, look, a thought appears in your head, right? That's obvious. Bang, it's nothing you ever ask about.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.640
But what the hell does that mean?

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.920
A thought appears in your head.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.660
What kind of ridiculous explanation is that?

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.400
It just doesn't help with anything.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.900
Where does it come from?

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.820
Well, nowhere. It just appears in my head.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:41.140
Okay, well, that's not a very sophisticated explanation, as it turns out.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.760
So you might think that those thoughts that you think, well, where do they come from?

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.800
Well, they're often someone else's thoughts, right?

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:55.440
Someone long dead, that might be part of it, just like the words you use to think are utterances of people who've been long dead.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.420
And so you're informed by the spirit of your ancestors, that's one way of looking at it.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:05.080
And your motivations speak to you, your emotions speak to you, your body speaks to you.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.780
And it does all that, at least in part, through the dream.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.480
And the dream is the birthplace of the fully articulated idea.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.820
They don't just come from nowhere fully fledged, right?

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:25.520
They have a developmental origin, and God only knows how lengthy that origin is, even to say something like, "I am conscious."

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.580
Chimpanzees don't say that.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:36.120
It's been seven million years since we broke from chimpanzees, something like that, from the common ancestor.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:43.320
They have no articulated knowledge at all and very little self-representation in some sense, and very little self-consciousness.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.320
And that's not the case with us at all.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:51.440
We had to painstakingly figure all of this out during that, you know, seven million year voyage.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:59.340
And I think some of that's represented and captured, in some sense, in these ancient stories.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:08.400
Which I believe were part of, especially the oldest stories, in Genesis, which are the stories we're going to start with, they were... that...

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:16.660
some of the archaic nature of the human being is encapsulated in those stories, and it's very, very instructive as far as I can tell.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.280
I'll give you just a quick example.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.820
You know there's an idea of sacrifice in the Old Testament.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:30.460
And it's pretty barbaric, you know, I mean the story of Abraham and Isaac, there's a good example of that because Abraham is called on to actually sacrifice his own son,

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.420
which doesn't really seem like something that a reasonable God would ask you to do, right?

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:40.880
God in the Old Testament is frequently cruel and arbitrary and demanding and paradoxical,

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:51.840
which is one of the things that really gives the book life because it wasn't edited by a committee, you know, a committee that was concerned with not offending anyone, that's for sure.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:14.580
So Jung believed that the dream was the birthplace of thought and I've been extending that idea because one of the things I wondered about deeply was,

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.780
you know, you have a dream and then someone interprets it.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:25.940
You can argue about whether or not an interpretation is valid, just like you can argue about whether your interpretation of a novel or movie is valid, right?

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.100
It's a very difficult thing to determine with any degree of accuracy,

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.420
which accounts in part for the post-modern critique.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:43.420
But my observations being that people will present a dream and sometimes we can extract out real useful information from it that the person didn't appear.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.140
And they get a flash of insight.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:52.620
To me that's a marker that we've stumbled on something that unites part of that person that wasn't united before.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:27:01.220
It pulls things together, which is often what a good story will do, whereas sometimes a good theory, you know if things snap together for you, there's a little light goes on,

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:05.940
and that's one of the markers that I've used for accuracy in dreams.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:13.900
In my own family, when I was first married, you know, I'd have fights with my wife, arguments about this and that.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:26.880
I'm fairly hot-headed and so I'd get all puffed up and agitated about whatever we were arguing about, and she'd go to sleep, which was really annoying, it is so annoying!

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:35.620
Because I couldn't sleep, right? I was like, chewing off my fingernails, and she'd, like, sleeping peacefully beside me and it's so maddening.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:43.260
But often she'd have a dream, you know, and then the next morning, she'd discuss it with me, and then we could unravel what was at the bottom of our argument.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:47.160
That was unbelievably useful, even though it was extraordinarily aggravating.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.580
So you know, I was convinced by Jung.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:28:00.420
It looked to me like his ideas about the relationship between dreams and mythology and drama and literature made sense to me and the relationship between that and art.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.140
I know this native carver, he's a Kwakwaka'wakw guy.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:10.180
He's carved a bunch of wooden sculptures, totem poles and masks that I have at my house.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.040
He's a very interesting person.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:18.080
Not literate, not particularly literate, and really still steeped in this ancient, 13,000 year old tradition.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:26.420
He's an original language speaker and the fact that he isn't literate has sort of left him with the mind of someone who's pre-literate.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:32.100
Pre-literate people aren't stupid, they're just not literate, so their brains are organized differently in many ways.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:42.280
And I've asked him about his intuition for his carvings, and he's told me that he dreams, like, you've seen the Haida masks, you know what they look like,

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:47.520
well, his people are mostly related to the Haida, so it's the same kind of style.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:53.320
And he said he dreams in those kind of animals, and can remember his dreams.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:29:01.840
And he also talks to his grandparents, who taught him how to carve, in his dreams quite often. If he runs into a problem with carving, his grandparents will come and he'll talk to them.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:09.420
But he sees the creatures that he's going to carve living, in an animated sense, in his imagination.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:15.080
I mean, it's not difficult. First of all, I have no reason to disbelieve him. He's a very, very straightforward person.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:20.860
And he doesn't the motivation or the guile, I would say, in some sense, to invent a story like that.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.060
There's just no reason he would possibly do it.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:26.820
I don't think he's told that many people about it. He thinks it's kind of crazy, you know?

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:31.700
He said when he was a kid, he thought he was insane because he'd have those dreams all the time.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.360
About these creatures and so forth.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.440
And so it wasn't something he was trumpeting.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:43.920
But I found it fascinating because I can see in him part of the manifestation of this unbroken tradition.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.600
We have no idea how traditions like that are really passed along for thousands and thousands of years, right?

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:55.620
Part of it's oral and memory, part of it's acted out and dramatized and then part of it's going to be imaginative.

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.180
And people who aren't literate, they store information quite differently than we do.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.060
We don't remember anything. It's all written down in books, right?

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:07.540
But if you're from an oral culture, especially if you're trained in that way, you have all of that information at hand.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.900
So you can speak and you can tell the stories, and you really know them.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.500
You know, modern people don't really know what that's like any more.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:20.640
I doubt if there's maybe more than two of you in the audience that could spout from memory, like, a thirty line poem.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.560
You know, and poetry was written so that people could do that.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:29.040
That's why we have that form, is so that people could remember it and have it with them.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.680
But we don't do any of that any more.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.120
Anyways, back to Jung.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:40.480
Jung was a great believer in the dream, and I know that dreams will tell you things that you don't know.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:47.780
And then I thought, well how the hell can that be? How in the world can something you think up tell you something you don't know?

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.760
How does that make any sense?

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:55.140
First of all, why don't you understand it? Why does it have to come forth in the form of the dream?

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.880
It's like you're not- there's something going on inside you that you don't control, right?

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.780
The dream happens to you just like life happens to you.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:09.300
I mean there is the odd lucid dreamer who can, you know, apply a certain amount of conscious control, but most of the time it's

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:16.480
you're laying there asleep and this crazy, complicated world manifests itself inside you.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.760
And you don't know how. You can't do it when you're awake.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.260
And you don't know what it means! It's like what the hell's going on?

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.920
And that's one of the things that's so damn frightening about the psychoanalysts, because

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:37.100
you get this with Freud and Jung, you really start to understand that there are things inside you that are happening that control you instead of the other way around.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:46.860
You, you know, use a bit of reciprocal control, but there's manifestations of spirits, so to speak, inside you that determine the manner in which you walk through life.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.000
And you don't control it. And what does?

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:59.860
Is it random? You know, there are people who have claimed that dreams are merely the consequence of random neuronal firing, which is a theory I think is absolutely absurd.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.380
Because there's nothing random about dreams.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.620
They're very, very structured and very, very complex.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:13.040
And not like snow on a television screen or static on the radio. Like, those things are complicated.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:18.980
And also, I've seen so often that people have very coherent dreams that have a perfect narrative structure.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:26.740
You know, they're fully developed, in some sense. And so that theory just doesn't go anywhere with me. I just can't see that as useful at all.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:34.480
So I'm more likely to take the phenomena seriously and say there's something to dreams.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.340
Well, you dream of the future and then you try to make it into a reality. That seems to be an important thing.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:47.740
Or maybe you dream up a nightmare and try to make that into a reality because people do that too, if they're hellbent on revenge, for example, full of hatred and resentment.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:53.720
And that manifests itself in terrible fantasies, you know, those are dreams, and then people go act them out.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:00.260
These things are powerful, you know, and nations can get caught up in collective dreams. That's what happened to the Nazis.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.060
That's what happened to Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:07.920
It was absolutely remarkable, amazing, horrific destructive spectacle.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:14.280
And the same thing happened in the Soviet Union, the same thing happened in China, it's like, we have to take these things seriously, you know?

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.580
Try to understand what's going on.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:24.280
So Jung believed that the dream could contain more information than was yet articulated.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.480
Artists do the same thing, you know.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.460
People go to museums and they look at paintings, Renaissance paintings, or modern paintings.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.600
And they don't exactly know why they're there.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:42.280
I was in this room in New York, I don't remember which museum, but it was a room full of Renaissance art.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:50.540
Great painters, the greatest painters and I thought maybe that room was worth a billion dollars, or something outrageous, because there was like twenty paintings in there, you know?

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.480
Priceless.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:58.280
And the first thing is, well why are those paintings worth so much, and why is there a museum in the biggest city in the world devoted to them,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.980
and why do people come from all over the world and look at them? What the hell are those people doing?

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:12.080
One of them was of the Assumption of Mary, beautifully painted, absolutely glowing work of art, and just, like, twenty people standing in front of it, looking at it.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.840
You think, what are those people up to?

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.800
They don't know, why did they make a pilgrimage to New York to come and look at that painting?

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.420
It's not like they know! Why is it worth so much?

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:27.840
I know there's a status element to it, too, but that begs the question: Why did those items become such high status items?

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.900
What is it about them that's so absolutely remarkable?

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.780
Well, we're strange creatures.

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:40.000
So I was trying to figure out in part, well where did the information that's in the dream come from?

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.920
Because it has to come from somewhere, and you can think about it as a revelation.

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:49.460
Because it's like it springs out of the void, it's new knowledge, it's a revelation.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.720
You didn't produce it, it just appears.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:59.260
See, one of the things that I want to do with this series is, like, I'm scientifically-minded, and I'm quite a rational person.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:05.180
And I like to have an explanation for things that's rational and empirical before I look for any other kind of explanation.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:14.220
And I don't want to say that everything that's associated with Divinity can be reduced in some manner to biology or to an evolutionary history, or anything like that.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:19.000
But insofar as it's possible to do that reduction, I'm going to do that.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:30.480
And I'm going to leave the other phenomena floating in the air because they can't be pinned down and in that category of mystical and religious experience, which we don't understand at all.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.980
So artists observe one another.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.940
They observe people and they represent what they see.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.520
And they transmit the message of what they see to us and they teach us to see it.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.020
We don't necessarily know what it is that we're learning from them.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.940
But we're learning something, or at least we're acting like we're learning something.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:57.020
We go to movies, we watch stories, we immerse ourselves in fiction constantly. That's an artistic production.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:03.560
And for many people, the world of the arts is a living world, and that's particularly true if you're a creative person.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:08.840
It's the creative, artistic people that do move the knowledge of humanity forward.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.360
And they do that with their artistic productions first. They're on the edge.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:19.540
The dancers do that, and the poets do that, and the visual artists do that, the musicians do that, and we're not sure what they're doing.

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:23.180
We're not sure what musicians are doing. What the hell are they doing? Why do you like music?

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.380
It gives you a deep intimation of the significance of things.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.800
And no one questions it. You go to a concert and you're thrilled, it's a quasi-religious experience,

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.440
particularly if people really get themselves together and get the crowd moving, you know?

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.340
There's something incredibly intense about it. It makes no sense whatsoever.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.000
It's not an easy thing to understand.

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:53.060
Music is deeply patterned, patterned in layers, and I think that has something to do with it because reality is deeply patterned in layers.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:37:01.900
And so I think music is representing reality in some fundamental way and that we get into the sway of that and sort of participate in being.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:05.640
And that's part of what makes it such an uplifting experience.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.640
But we don't really know that's what we're doing, we just go do it.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.900
And it's nourishing for people, right?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:19.120
Young people in particular, lots of them live for music, it's where they derive all their meaning, their cultural identity.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.260
Everything that's nourishing comes from their affiliation with their music.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.860
It's part of their cultural identity. So that's an amazing thing.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.320
The question still remains: Where does the information in dreams come from?

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:42.680
I think where it comes from is that we watch the patterns that everyone acts out.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:47.720
We've watched that forever and we've got some representations of those patterns.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:53.860
That's part of our cultural history, that's what's embedded in stories, in fictional accounts, of the story between good and evil.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.100
The bad guy and the good guy.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:59.260
And the romance, you know? These are canonical patterns of being for people.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.920
And they deeply affect us because they represent what it is that we will act out in the world.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.660
And then we flesh that out with the individual information we have about ourselves and other people.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:18.900
And so it's like there's waves of behavioral patterns that manifest themselves in the crowd across time.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.200
The great dramas are played on the crowd across time.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:30.360
And the artists watch that and they get intimations of what that is and they write it down and they tell us, and then we're a little clearer about what we're up to.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:37.500
A great dramatist like Shakespeare, let's say, we know that what he wrote is fiction. And then we say, well, fiction isn't true.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:42.140
But then you think, well, wait a minute. Maybe it's true like numbers are true.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:49.680
You know? Numbers are an abstraction from the underlying reality but no one in their right mind would really think numbers aren't true.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:54.560
You can even make a case that the numbers are more real than the things that they represent, right?

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:57.280
Because the abstraction is so insanely powerful.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.080
Once you have mathematics, you're just deadly.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.500
You can move the world with mathematics.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:09.560
It's not obvious that the abstraction is less real than the more concrete reality.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:15.740
I mean, take a work of fiction, like Hamlet, and think it's not true because it's fiction.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.540
But then you think wait a minute, what kind of explanation is that?

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.300
Maybe it's more true than nonfiction.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:28.200
Because it takes the story that needs to be told about you and the story that needs to be told about you and you and you and you

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:34.320
and abstracts that out and says look, here's something that's a key part of the human experience, as such.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:39.720
Right? So it's an abstraction from this underlying, noisy substrate.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:46.940
And people are affected by it because they see that the thing that's represented is part of the pattern of their being.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.640
That's the right way to think about it.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:55.600
And then with these old stories, with these ancient stories, it seems to me like that process has been occurring for thousands of years.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.240
It's like we we watched ourselves and we extracted out some stories.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:07.380
We imitated each other and we represented that in drama, and then we distilled the drama and we got a representation of the distillation.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:14.520
And then we did it again and at the end of that process that took God only knows how long- I think some of these stories...

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:21.160
They've traced fairy tales back ten thousand years, some fairy tales, in relatively unchanged form.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.360
And certainly seems to me that the archaeological evidence, for example,

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:34.720
suggests that the really old stories that the Bible begins with are at least that old and likely embedded in a pre-history that's far older than that.

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.060
And you might think, well, how can you be so sure?

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:45.120
And the answer to that in part is that cultures that don't change, like the ancient cultures, like they didn't change as fast as...

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.140
They stayed the same! That's the answer.

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:53.540
So they keep their information moving generation to generation, that's how they stay the same.

00:40:54.060 --> 00:41:01.640
And so we know, again in the archaeological record, there are records of rituals that have remained relatively unbroken through up to twenty thousand years,

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:09.540
was discovered in caves in Japan that were set up for a particular kind of bear worship that was also characteristic of Western Europe.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.180
So these things can last for very long periods of time.

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.200
We're watching each other act in the world.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.100
And then the question is well how long have we been watching each other?

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:28.220
And the answer to that in some sense is, well, as long as there's been creatures with nervous systems.

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:32.940
That's a long time, you know? That's some hundreds of millions of years, perhaps longer than that.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:36.040
We've been watching each other trying to figure out what we're up to

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.400
across that entire span of time, some of that knowledge is built right into our bodies.

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.220
Which is why we can dance with each other for example, right?

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.260
Because understanding isn't just something

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:51.080
that you have as an abstraction , it's something that you act out, you know?

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.220
That's what children are doing when they learning to rough-and-tumble play.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:59.220
They're learning to integrate their body with the body of someone else in a harmonious way and

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:03.660
learning to cooperate and compete and that's all instantiated right into their body.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.700
It's not abstract knowledge, they don't know that they doing that.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.140
They're just doing it.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:12.120
And so we can even use our body as a representational platform.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.960
So we've been studying each other for a long time,

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.700
abstracting out what is it that we're up to, and that's...

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:24.560
What is it we're up to, what should we be up to? That's even a more fundamental question.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.720
If you're going to live in the world and you're going to do it properly,

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.560
what does properly mean and how is it that you might go about that?

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.940
Well, it's the right question, right? It's what everyone wants to know.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.600
How do you live in the world?

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.420
Not what is the world made of. It's not  the same question.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:40.860
How do you live in the world?

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:43.200
It's the eternal question of human beings.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.780
And I guess we're the only species that has ever really asked that question

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.840
because all the other animals, they just go and do whatever they do.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.720
Not us!

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.660
It's a question for us.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:56.760
We have to become aware of it, we have to be able to speak it.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.380
God only knows why

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.860
but thats seems to be the situation.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.140
So...

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:08.660
We act, that acting is shaped by the world, that acting is shaped by society

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.560
into something that we don't understand, but that we can model.

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:16.020
That we can model. We model it our stories, we model it with our bodies.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.740
And that's where the dream gets its information.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.800
The dream is part of the process that's watching everything

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.800
and then trying to formulate it

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:28.760
and trying to say, well, trying to get the signal out from the noise and to portray in dramatic form.

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.400
Because a dream is a little drama.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.440
And then you get the chance to talk about what that dream is.

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.140
And then you have it...

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.120
you have something like articulated  knowledge at that point.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.320
And so the Bible I would say is...

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:48.340
It's sort of...it exists in that space that's half into the dream and half into articulated knowledge.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:49.740
It's something like that.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.180
Going into it to find out what the stories are about,

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:54.520
Then...

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.080
We can aid our self-understanding.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.700
The other issue is that

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:04.840
if Nietzsche was correct, and if Dostoevsky, or Jung was correct

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.340
and Dostoevsky as well,

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:13.300
without the cornerstone that that understanding provides, we're lost!

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:16.840
And that's not good, because then we're susceptible

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.480
to psychic pathology. That's psychological pathology.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:27.200
You know, people who are adamant anti religious thinkers

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:32.000
seem to believe that if we abandoned our immersement in the underlying dream,

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.340
that we'd all instantly become rationalists like Descartes or Bacon, you know?

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:41.480
Intelligent, clear thinking rational, scientific people and I don't believe that for a moment,

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.400
because I don't think there is any evidence for it.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:50.780
I think we would become so irrational so rapidly that the weirdest mysteries of Catholicism would seem positively

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:54.100
rational by contrast and I think that's already happening.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:55.420
So.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:01.960
[CLAPPING]

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:03.720
Okay.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.800
So, this is the idea essentially, you know, that

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:13.280
you have the unknown world. That's just what you don't know at all.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.420
That's the outside, that's the ocean that surrounds the island that you inhabit.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:19.700
Something like that, it's chaos itself.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:20.680
And then

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:24.420
You act in that world and you act in ways you don't understand.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.220
There's more to your actions then you can understand.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.160
One of the things Jung said, I loved this, when I first understood it,

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.980
He said "Everybody acts out a myth, but very few people know what their myth is."

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:38.220
And you should know what your myth is because it might be a tragedy.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.480
And maybe you don't want it to be.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.580
And that's really worth thinking because

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.060
thinking about because your...

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:47.100
You have a pattern of behaviour that characterises you, you know?

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.920
And God only knows where you got it.

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.020
Partly it's biological, partly it's from your parents.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.500
It's your unconscious assumptions.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.280
It's the way the philosophy of your society shaped you.

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.980
And is, it's aimed, it's aiming you somewhere.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.860
Well, is it aiming you somewhere you want to go?

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:06.340
That's a good question, that's part of self-realization, you know?

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.160
We know we don't understand our actions.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.640
That's almost every argument you have with someone is about that.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.480
It's like "Why did you do that?"

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.100
And you come up with some half baked reasons why you did it.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.520
You're flailing around in the darkness, you know?

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:24.680
You try to give an account for yourself, but you can only do it partially. It's very, very difficult because

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:31.840
you're a complicated animal with the beginnings of an articulated mind, something like that.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.260
And you're just way more than you can handle.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.720
All right, so you act things out, right?

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:40.780
You act things out.

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.180
And that's a kind of competence.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.520
And then you imagine what you act out.

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.800
And you imagine what everyone else acts out, and so

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.180
there's a tremendous amount of information in your action.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.600
And then, that information is translated up into the dream

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.560
and into art and to mythology and literature.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.760
And there's a tremendous amount of information in that.

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:04.120
And then some of that is translated into articulated thought.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.380
And I'll give you a quick example of something like that.

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:10.720
I think this is partly what happens in Exodus, when Moses comes up with the law.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.700
You know, he's wandering around with the Israelites forever in the desert.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:18.280
They're going left and going right and worshiping idols and having a hell of a time.

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.180
You know, getting rebellious.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.740
And Moses goes up on the mountain and he has this tremendous revelation

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.440
sort of, in the sight of God

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:29.240
and it illuminates him and he comes down with the law.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.100
You think, well,

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.800
Moses acted as a judge, I know this is a mythological story.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.200
Moses acted as a judge in the desert.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.560
He was continually mediating between people who are having problems.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.640
Constantly trying to keep peace.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.700
And so what are you doing when you're trying to keep peace?

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.820
You're trying to understand what peace is.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.260
Right? You have to apply the principles.

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.840
Well what are the principles? Well you don't know.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:54.540
The principles are whatever satisfies people enough to make peace.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.860
And maybe you do that ten thousand times and then

00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.060
you get some sense of "Oh! Here's the principles that bring peace."

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:04.260
And then one day it blasts into your consciousness like a revelation.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.220
Here's the rules that we're already acting out.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:10.220
That's the Ten Commandments. They're there to begin with.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:16.500
And Moses comes forward and says "Look, this is already basically what we're doing but now it's codified, right?"

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.580
That's all a historical process that's condensed into

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.720
a single story but, obviously, that happened

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.980
Because we have written law!

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.080
Right? And that emerged, in good legal systems,

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.000
that emerges from the bottom up.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.580
English Common Law is exactly like that.

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:36.380
It's single decisions that are predicated on principles,

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:40.480
that are then articulated and made into the body of law.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.720
The body of law is something you act out.

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:44.940
That's why it's a body of law.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.940
if you're good citizen you act out the body of law.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.120
And the body of law has principles.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.140
Okay, so the question is, there's principles that guide our behavior.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.160
What are those principles?

00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:03.720
Well I think if you want the initial answer of what the archaic Israelites meant by God,

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.140
that's something like what they meant.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.580
Now it's not a good enough explanation.

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:14.820
But imagine if you're a chimpanzee and you have a powerful,

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:19.660
dominant figure at the pinnacle of your society.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.500
That represents power, more than that.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:26.700
Because it's not sheer physical prowess that keeps a chimp at the top of the hierarchy.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.400
It's much more complicated than that.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:34.400
And you can say, well there's a principle that the dominant person manifests.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:42.240
And then you might say, well, that principle shines forth even more brightly if you know ten people who are dominant.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.040
Powerful.

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:46.660
And you can extract out what dominance means from that.

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.800
You can extract out what power means from that.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:52.460
And then you can divorce the concept from the people.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:59.360
And we had to do that at some point because we can say power, in a human context, and we can imagine what that means.

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:03.240
But it's divorced from any specific manifestation of power.

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.900
Well how the hell did we do that?

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.840
That's so complicated!

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.320
If you're a chimp,

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:13.040
the power is in another chimp, it's not some damn abstraction.

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:19.300
So the question is, think about it, we're in these hierarchies, many of them, across centuries.

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:22.000
We're trying to figure what the guiding principle is.

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:25.660
Trying to extract out the core of the guiding principle

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:29.720
And we turn that into a representation of a pattern of being.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.460
Well it's something like that that's God.

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.060
It's an abstracted ideal.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:43.820
And it's put in personified form, manifests itself in personified form, but that's okay because what we're trying to get at is the

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:51.580
in some sense, the essence of what it means to be a properly functioning, properly social,

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.940
and properly competent individual.

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.460
We're trying to figure out what that means.

00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:02.060
You need an embodiment. You need an ideal that's abstracted that you could act out

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:04.860
that would enable you to understand what that means.

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:06.720
And that's what we've been driving at.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.620
So that's the first hypothesis, in some sense.

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:17.920
I'm going to go over some of the attributes of this abstracted ideal that we formalized as God, but that's the first sort of hypothesis, is that

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:27.220
a philosophical or moral ideal manifests itself first as a concrete pattern of behavior that's characteristic of a single individual.

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:29.700
And then it's a set of individuals.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.280
And then it's an abstraction from that set.

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:35.300
And then you have the abstraction. It's so important.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.940
So here's a political implication, for example.

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:52.700
One of the debates, we might say, between Early Christianity and the Late Roman Empire

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:58.040
was whether or not an Emperor could be God, literally, right?

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.920
To be deified to put in a temple.

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:09.120
And you can see why that might happen because that's someone at the pinnacle of a very steep hierarchy who has a tremendous amount of power and influence.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.880
But the Christian response to that was,

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:19.720
never confuse the specific sovereign with the principle of sovereignty itself.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.280
It's brilliant.

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:28.440
You see how difficult it is to come up with an idea like that so that even the person who has the power is actually subordinate to something else.

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:33.520
Subordinate to, let's call it a divine principle, for lack of a better word.

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:37.820
So that even the king himself is subordinate to the principle.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:43.900
And we still believe that, because we believe that our President, or our Prime Minister, is subordinate to the damn law.

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:50.000
Whatever, the body of law, right? There's a principle inside that that even the leader is subordinate to.

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:58.480
Without that, you could argue you can't even have a civilized society because your leader immediately turns into something that's transcendent and all powerful.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:04.060
That's certainly what happened in the Soviet Union, and what happened in Maoist China, and what happened in Nazi Germany.

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:07.960
Because there was nothing for the powerful to subordinate themselves to.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.620
You're supposed to be subordinate to God.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:11.960
So what does that mean?

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:20.160
Well, we're gonna tear that idea apart, but partly what it means is that you're subordinate, even if you're sovereign, to the principle of sovereignty itself.

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.800
And then the question is, what the hell is the principle of sovereignty?

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:27.860
And I could say, we have been working that out for a very long period of time.

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.600
And so that's one of the things that we'll talk about.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:39.320
Because the ancient Mesopotamians and the ancient Egyptians had some very interesting dramatic ideas about that.

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:45.460
Just for example, very briefly, there was a deity known as Marduk.

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:53.300
And Marduk, he was a Mesopotamian deity, and imagine this is sort of what happened is that as an empire grew

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:58.740
out the post-Ice Age age, say fifteen thousand years ago, ten thousand years ago,

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.580
all these tribes came together.

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:04.340
And these tribes each had their own deity, their own image of the ideal.

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:06.940
But then they started to occupy the same territory, right?

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:13.880
And so then one tribe had god A and one tribe had god B and one could wipe the other one out.

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.200
And then it would just be god A who wins.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:22.440
But that's not so good because, well, maybe you want to trade with those people, or maybe you don't want to lose half your population in a war,

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:23.320
something like that.

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:28.480
So then you have to have an argument about whose god is going to take priority.

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.440
Which ideal is going to take priority?

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:36.900
What seems to happen is that's represented in mythology as a battle of the gods in sort of celestial  space.

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:40.540
But from a practical perspective, it's more like an ongoing dialog.

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.520
You believe this, I believe this.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.080
You believe that, I believe this.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.160
How are we going to meld that together?

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:52.600
So you take god A and you take god B, and maybe what you do is extract god C from them.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.080
And you say, well, god C now has the attributes of A and B.

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:57.860
And then some other tribes come in.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.340
And then C takes them over too.

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:04.060
Like with Marduk, for example, he has a multitude of names.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:12.800
Fifty different names. Well, those are names, at least in part, of the subordinate gods that represented the tribes that came together to make the civilization.

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.840
That's part of the process by which that abstracted ideal is abstracted.

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:20.480
You think this is important, and it works because you're tribe's alive.

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:23.420
And you think this is important, and it works, because your tribe's alive.

00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:27.040
And so we'll take the best of both if we can manage it,

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:32.340
and extract out something that's even more abstract that covers both of us if we can do it.

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:37.960
One of the things that's really interesting about Marduk, I'll just give you a couple of his features.

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.660
He has eyes all the way around his head.

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:45.480
He's elected by all the other gods to be king god, so that's the first thing, that's quite cool.

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.820
And they elect him because they're facing a terrible threat.

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:52.340
Sort of like a flood and a monster combined, something like that.

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:58.420
And Marduk basically says that if they elect him top god, then he'll go out and stop the flood monster.

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:04.360
And they won't all get wiped out. It's a serious threat, it's chaos itself, making its comeback.

00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:10.400
And so all the gods agree and Marduk has a new manifestation. He's got eyes all the way around his head.

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.280
And he speaks magic words.

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:17.040
And then he also goes out and when he fights, he fights this deity called Tiamat.

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:24.200
And we need to know that because the word "Tiamat" is associated with the word "Tehom," T, E, H, O, M.

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:29.740
And Tehom is the chaos that God makes order out of at the beginning of time in Genesis.

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:32.340
So it's linked very tightly to this story.

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:39.780
And Marduk with his eyes and his capacity to speak magic words goes out to confront Tiamat, who's like a watery sea dragon.

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:40.780
Something like that.

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:48.740
It's a classic St. George story, go out and wreak havoc on the dragon.

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:50.540
And he cuts her into pieces.

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:54.560
And he makes the world out of her pieces, and that's the world that human beings live in.

00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:57.780
And the Mesopotamian emperor acted out Marduk.

00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:00.700
He was allowed to be emperor insofar as he was a good Marduk.

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:05.000
And so that meant that he had eyes all the way around his head, and he could speak magic.

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:06.580
He could speak properly.

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:11.140
And so we're starting to understand there at that point the essence of leadership, right?

00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.360
Because what's leadership?

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:17.260
It's the capacity to see what the hell's in front of your face and maybe in every direction.

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:23.560
And then the capacity to use your language properly, in a transformative manner, and to transform chaos into order.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.160
And god only knows how long it took the Mesopotamians to figure that out.

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.140
The best they could do is dramatize it.

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.700
But it's staggeringly brilliant.

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:38.620
You know? It's by no means obvious. And this chaos, this chaos is a very strange thing.

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.740
This is the chaos that God wrestled with at the beginning of time.

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:46.000
Chaos is what- it's half psychological and half real.

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:48.340
There's no other way to really describe it.

00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:52.940
The chaos is what you encounter when you're thrown into deep confusion.

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:55.140
When your world falls apart.

00:57:55.240 --> 00:58:00.060
When you encounter something that blows you into pieces, when your dreams die, when you're betrayed.

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.040
It's the chaos that emerges.

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:05.000
And the chaos is everything at once, and it's too much for you.

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.920
And that's for sure, and it pulls you down into the underworld and all,

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:14.060
that's where the dragons are, and all you've got at that point is your capacity to bloody well keep your eyes open,

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:16.780
and to speak as carefully and clearly as you can.

00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:20.700
And maybe if you're lucky, you'll get through it that way and come out the other side.

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:23.960
And it's taken people a very long time to figure that out.

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.000
And it looks to me like the idea is

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:32.320
erected on the platform of our ancient ancestors, maybe tens of millions of years ago.

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:44.600
Because we seem to represent that which disturbs us deeply using the same system that we use to represent serpentile or other carnviorous predators.

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.660
You know, we're biological creatures, right?

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:53.780
When we've formulated our capacity to abstract, our strange capacity to abstract and use language,

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:59.260
we still have all those underlying systems that were there when we were only animals.

00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:05.780
And we have to use those systems, they're part of the emotional and motivational architecture of our thinking.

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:13.420
Part of the reason we can demonize our enemies who upset our axioms is because we perceive them as if they're carnivorous predators.

00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:15.460
We do it with the same system.

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:19.000
And that's chaos itself, the thing that always threatens us, right?

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.520
The snakes that hang through the trees when we lived in them like sixty million years ago.

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.360
It's the same damn systems.

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:26.600
So

00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:35.980
the Marduk story is partly the story of using attention and language to confront those things that most threaten us.

00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:39.700
And some of those things are real-world threats.

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:44.400
But some of them are psychological threats, which are just as profound but far more abstract.

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:47.280
But we use the same systems to represent them.

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.360
It's why you freeze if you're frightened.

00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:52.240
Right? You're a prey animal. You're like a rabbit.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:56.040
You've seen a something that's going to eat you, you freeze.

00:59:56.520 --> 01:00:03.260
And that way you're paralyzed, you're turned to stone, which is what you do when you see a medusa with a head full of snakes, right?

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.060
You're turned to stone, you're paralyzed.

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:12.240
And the reason you do that is because you're using the predator detection system to protect yourself. Your heart rate goes way up,

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.280
and you get ready to move.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.840
Things that upset us lie on that system.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.540
And then the story, the Marduk story, for example

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:29.200
is the idea that if there are things that upset you, chaotic, terrible, serpentine monstrous underworld things that threaten you,

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:36.040
the best thing thing to do is to open your eyes, get your speech organized, and go out and confront the thing, and make the world out of it.

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:41.900
And it's staggering when I read that story and started to understand it, it just blew me away.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:50.540
That it's such a profound idea, and we know it's true too because we know in psychotherapy, for example, that you're much better off to confront your fears head on

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.500
than you are to wait and let them find you.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:01:00.380
And so partly, what you do, if you're a psychotherapist, is you help people break their fears into little pieces, the things that upset them,

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.800
and then to encounter them one by one and master them.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:08.920
And so you're teaching this process of eternal mastery over the strange and chaotic world.

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:15.260
And all of that makes up some of the background for, we haven't even gotten to the first sentence of the Biblical stories yet.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.700
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:22.480
[CLAPPING]

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.500
But all of that makes up the background.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:32.860
So you have to think that we've extracted this story, this strange collection of stories, with all its errors and its repetitions,

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:38.820
and its peculiarities, out of the entire history that we've been able to collect ideas.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.400
And it's the best we've been able to do.

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:49.160
I know there are other religious traditions, but I'm not concerned about that at the moment because we can use this as an example.

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:58.780
But it's the best we've been able to do, and what I'm hoping is that we can return to the stories in some sense with an open mind and see if there's something there that we actually need.

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:02.200
And I hope that that will be the case.

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.440
As I said, I'll approach them as rationally as I possibly can.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.660
So this is the idea to begin with.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.420
We have the unknown as such, and then we act in it, like animals act.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.400
They act first. They don't think, they don't imagine, they act.

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:19.780
That's where we started, we started by acting.

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:23.280
And then we started to be able to represent how we acted.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.900
And then we started to talk about how we represented how we acted.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:34.740
And that enabled us to tell stories because that is what a story is, it's to tell about how you represent how you act.

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:38.140
And so you know that because if you read a book, what happens?

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:43.700
You read the book and images come to mind of the people in the book behaving, right?

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.120
It's one step from acting it out.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:51.580
You don't act it out because you can abstract and represent action without having to act it out.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.080
It's an amazing thing, and that's part of the development of the prefrontal cortex.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:06.780
It's part of the capacity for human abstract thought is that you can pull the behavior, the representation of the behavior, away from the behavior and manipulate the representation before you enact it.

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:16.300
That's why you think, so that you can generate a pattern of action and test it out in a fictional world before you embody it and die because you're foolish.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.380
Right? You let the representation die, not you.

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:21.700
And that's why you think.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.840
And so that's partly what we're trying to do with these stories.

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.400
What do I hope to accomplish?

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:35.660
I hope to end this twelve-lecture series knowing more than I did when I started.

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.180
That's my goal.

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:42.380
Because I said I'm not telling you what I know, I'm trying to figure things out.

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:48.140
This is part of the process by which I'm doing that.

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.580
And so I'm doing my best to think on my feet, you know?

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:59.420
I've come prepared, but I'm trying to stay on the edge of my capacity to generate knowledge and to make this continually clearer

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:00.960
and to get to the bottom of things.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:05.120
I'm hoping that that's what I'm going to accomplish.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:09.760
It seems like people are interested in that, so then we're going to try to accomplish that together.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.240
And so that's the plan.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:18.980
And the idea is to see if there's something at the bottom of this amazing civilization that we've managed to construct.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:24.980
That I think is in peril for a variety of reasons.

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:31.140
And maybe if we understand it a little bit better we won't be so prone just to throw the damn thing away.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.120
Which I think would be a big mistake.

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:42.380
And to throw it away because of resentment and hatred and bitterness and historical ignorance and jealously and desire for destruction, and all of that.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.340
It's like, I don't want to go there.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.520
It's a bad idea to go there.

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:48.580
We need to be grounded better.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.420
Hopefully, well, we'll see how this works.

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.280
All right, so how do I approach this?

01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:00.480
Well, first of all, I think in evolutionary terms, you know?

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:07.260
As far as I'm concerned the cosmos is fifteen billion years old and the world is four and a half billion years old.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:16.540
And there's been life for three and a half billion years and there were creatures that had pretty developed nervous systems three hundred to six hundred million years ago.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:21.320
And we were living in trees as small mammals sixty million years ago.

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:28.140
We were down on the plains between sixty million and seven million years ago and that's about when we split from chimpanzees.

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:31.980
And modern human beings seem to emerge about a hundred and fifty thousand years ago

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:37.540
And civilization pretty much after the last Ice Age, something after fifteen thousand years ago.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.800
Not very long ago at all, you know?

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:43.980
And that's the span across which I want to understand.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.200
That's the span across which I want to understand.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:55.340
I want to understand why we are the way we are, looking at life in its continual complexity right from the beginning of life itself.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:06:04.180
There's some real utility in that because we share attributes with other animals, even animals as simple as crustaceans, for example,

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:09.600
have nervous system properties that are very much like ours, and it's very much worth knowing that.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.880
And so I think in an evolutionary way.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:17.680
I think it's a grand and remarkable way to think because it has this incredible timespan.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:25.420
It's amazing that people at the end of the nineteenth century, middle of the nineteenth century, say,

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.660
really thought the world was about six thousand years old.

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:37.660
Fifteen billion years old, that's a lot more, right? It's a lot grander, it's a lot bigger, but it's also a lot more frightening and alienating in some sense.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:45.500
Because the cosmos has become so vast, it's either easy for human beings to think of themselves as trivial specks on a trivial speck

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:52.980
out some misbegotten hellhole end of the galaxy, among hundreds of millions of galaxies, right?

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:56.800
It's very easy to see yourself as nothing in that span of time.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.660
That's a real challenge for people.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:01.620
I think it's a mistake to think that way.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:07.740
Because I think consciousness is far more than we think it is, but it's still something we have to grapple with.

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.380
I'm a psychoanalytic thinker.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:19.140
And what that means is that I believe that people are collections of sub-personalities, and that those sub-personalities are alive.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.760
They're not machines.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:28.040
They have their viewpoint, they have their wants, they have their perceptions, they have their arguments, they have their emotions.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.520
They're like low-resolution representations of you when you get angry.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.600
It's like, it's a very low resolution representation of you.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:41.740
It only wants rage, or it only wants something to eat, or it only wants water, it only wants sex.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.780
It's you but shrunk and focused in a specific direction.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:53.260
And all those motivational systems are very, very ancient, very archaic, and very, very powerful.

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:57.880
And they play a determining role in the manner in which we manifest ourselves.

01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:05.840
And as Freud pointed out with the id, we have to figure out how to take all those underlying animalistic motivations and emotions and

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:17.720
civilize them in some way so that we can all live in the same, general territory without tearing each other to shreds, which is maybe the default position of both chimpanzee and humanity.

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:24.280
So I take that seriously, the idea that we're a loose collection of spirits.

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:32.060
You know, it says in the Old Testament somewhere that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, and I think this is akin to that.

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:38.300
If you know that you're not in control of yourself thoroughly, that there are other factors behind the scenes,

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:43.060
like the Greeks thought that human beings were the playthings of the gods.

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.220
That's the way they conceptualized the world.

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:52.380
And they sort of meant the same thing. They meant that there are these great forces that move us that we don't create.

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:59.080
That we're subordinate to, in some sense. Not entirely, but we can be subordinate to them, and they move our destinies.

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.620
That was the Greek view, and there's something...

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.640
It teaches you humility to understand that.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.520
That there's a hell of a lot more going on behind the scenes and you're the driver of a very complex vehicle, but you don't understand the vehicle very well.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:21.280
And it's got its own motivations and methods and sometimes you think it's doing something, and it's doing something completely different.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:28.320
You see that in psychotherapy all the time because you help someone unwind a pattern of behavior that they've manifested forever.

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:33.120
First of all, they describe it, then they become aware of it, then maybe they start to see what the cause is.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.320
They had no idea why they were acting like that.

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:40.760
You know, they have to have the memory that produced the behavioral pattern to begin with.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:47.480
It has to be brought back to mind, and then it has to be analyzed and assessed, and then they have to think about a different way of acting.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.760
It's extraordinarily complex.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.920
So, psychoanalytic.

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:53.800
Literary.

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:55.120
Well,

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:05.920
there's this new, this postmodern idea about literature, and about the world, for that matter, that

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:11.500
you take a complex piece of literature, like a Shakespeare play.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:15.080
There's no end to the number of interpretations that you can make of it.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:20.580
You know, you can interpret each word, you can interpret each phrase, each sentence, each paragraph.

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:22.180
You can interpret the entire play.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:28.040
The way you interpret it depends on how many other books you've read, depends on your orientation in the world.

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:34.780
It depends on a very, very large number of things. How cultured you are or how much culture you lack.

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.040
All of those things.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:40.300
It opens up a huge vista for potential interpretation.

01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:49.240
And so the Postmoderns sort of stubbed their toe on that and thought, well, if there's this vast number of interpretations of any particular literary work,

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:53.640
how can be sure that any interpretation is more valid than any other interpretation?

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.040
And if you can't be sure, then how do you even know those are great works?

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.060
How do you know...

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:05.440
Maybe they're just works that the people in power have used to facilitate their continual accession of power,

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:11.500
which is really a Post-modern idea, and a very, very cynical one, but it has its point.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.620
But the thing is it's grounded in something real, right?

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:16.020
It's like, yes, you can interpret things forever.

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:18.920
I want to show you something here, just briefly.

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.160
We'll go back to it later.

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.120
Look at this.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.720
This is one of the coolest things I've ever seen.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:29.140
So at the bottom here, every single one of those lines is a Biblical verse.

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:30.160
Okay?

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:38.700
Now, the length of the line is proportionate to how many times that verse is referred to in some way by some other verse.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:44.440
So, you say, this is the first hyper-linked book.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.340
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:47.660
Right? I'm dead serious about that!

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:54.340
You can't click and get the hyper-links, obviously, but it's a thoroughly hyper-linked book and it's because, well the people who worked on these stories

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.100
that are hypothetically at the end, right?

01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:01.240
Which is the end can't affect the beginning. That's the rule of time, right?

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:06.900
What happens now can't affect what happened to you ten years ago, even though it actually can, but whatever.

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:07.740
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:12.260
Well, you re-interpret things, right, and then they're not the same, but whatever, we won't get into that.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:19.720
Technically speaking, the present can not affect the past, but if you were looking at a piece of literature, that's not right.

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:25.280
Because when you write the end, you know what was at the beginning, and when you write the beginning or edit it, you know what's at the end.

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:27.840
And so you can weave the whole thing together.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:32.400
And there's sixty-five thousand cross-references, and that's what this map shows.

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:35.380
And so that's a great visual representation of the book.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.440
And then you can see, well why is it deep? Why is the book deep?

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.720
Well, just imagine how many pathways you could take through that.

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:46.840
Right? I mean you'd just journey through that forever, you'd never ever get to the end of it.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:53.680
There's permutations and combinations, and every phrase is dependent on every other phrase and every verse is dependent on every, not entirely,

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:57.440
not entirely, but sixty-five thousand is not a bad start.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:58.700
And so

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:08.420
Okay, well so that's another issue, in some sense, that seems to make the Post-Modernist critique correct.

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:12.720
How in the world are you going to extract out a canonical interpretation of something like THAT?

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:14.180
It's like it's not possible.

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:17.460
But here's the issue, as far as I can tell.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:21.640
So the Post-Modernists extended that critique to the world.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:26.340
They said look, now the text is complicated enough, you can't extract out a canonical interpretation.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.880
What about the world?

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:30.260
The world's way more complicated than a text.

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:33.740
And so there's an infinite number of ways that you can look at the world.

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:36.980
And so how do we know that any one way is better than any other way?

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.720
That's a good question.

01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:42.940
Now the Post-Modern answer was we can't.

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:48.080
And that's not a good answer because you drown in chaos under those circumstances, right?

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.380
You can't make sense of anything.

01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:51.020
And that's not good because

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:56.080
it's not neutral to not make sense of things.

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:58.900
It's very anxiety-provoking.

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:06.500
It's very depressing because if things are so chaotic that you can't get a handle on them, your body defaults into emergency-preparation mode

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:15.880
and your heart rate goes up and your immune system stops working and you burn yourself out, you age rapidly because you're surrounded by nothing you can control.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:21.760
That's an existential crisis, right? It's anxiety-provoking and depressing, very hard on people.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:29.380
And even more than that, it turns out that the way that we're constructed neurophysiologically is that we don't experience any positive emotion

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.000
unless we have an aim,

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:35.160
and we can see ourselves progressing toward that aim.

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:39.480
It isn't precisely attaining the aim that makes us happy.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.900
As you all know if you've ever attained anything, because as soon as you attain it, then the whole little game ends,

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:47.680
and you have to come up with another game.

01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:49.780
Right, so it's Sisyphus.

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:51.260
And that's okay.

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:56.380
But it does show that the attainment can't be the thing that drives you because it collapses the game.

01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:58.380
That's what happens when you graduate from university.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:06.620
It's like, you're king of the mountain for one day, and then you're like, serf, at Starbucks for the next five years, you know?

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:07.500
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:18.080
So what happens is that human beings are weird creatures because we're much more activated by having an aim and moving towards it than we are by attainment.

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:22.180
And what that means is you have to have an aim and that means you have to have an interpretation.

01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:27.960
And it also means that the nobler the aim, that's one way of thinking about it, the better your life.

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:35.860
And that's a really interesting thing to know because you've heard ever since you were tiny that you should act like a good person and you shouldn't lie, for example.

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:40.920
And you might think, well, why the hell should I act like a good person and why not lie?

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:46.360
I mean, even a three year old can ask that question because smart kids learn to lie earlier, by the way.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:54.140
And they think well, why not twist the fabric of reality so that it serves your specific short-term needs?

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:56.340
I mean, that's a great question, why not do that?

01:15:56.340 --> 01:16:01.760
Why act morally if you can get away with something and it brings you closer to something you want?

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.220
Well, why not do it?

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:06.360
These are good questions, it's not self-evident.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:10.040
Well, it seems to me tied in with what I just mentioned.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:14.140
It's like, you de-stabilize yourself and things become chaotic, and that's not good.

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:21.500
And if you don't have a noble aim, then you have nothing but shallow, trivial pleasures.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.760
And they don't sustain you.

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:29.840
And that's not because because life is so difficult, it's so much suffering, it's so complex.

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:32.740
It ends, and everyone dies, and it's painful.

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:36.380
It's like without a noble aim, how can you withstand any of that?

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:37.420
You can't.

01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:43.580
You become desperate, and once you become desparate, things go from bad to worse very rapidly.

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:46.820
And so there's the idea of the noble aim.

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:50.300
And it's something that's necessary.

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.480
It's the bread that people cannot live without, right?

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.480
That's not physical bread, it's the noble aim.

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.660
And what is that?

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:57.580
Well,

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.720
It was encapsulated in part in the story of Marduk.

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:08.460
It's to pay attention, it's to speak properly, it's to confront chaos, it's to make a better world, it's something like that.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:21.420
And that's enough of a noble aim so that you can stand up without cringing at the very thought of your own existence so that you can do something that's worthwhile to justify your wretched position on the planet.

01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:25.120
Now the literary issue is that...

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.020
look,

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.820
you take a text, you can interpret it in a variety of ways, but that's not right.

01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:34.200
This is where the Post-Modernists went wrong because

01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:41.460
what you're looking for, in a text, and in the world, for that matter, is sufficient order and direction.

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:45.600
So then we have to think, well what does sufficient order and direction mean?

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:49.640
Well you don't want to suffer so much that your life is unbearable, right?

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.220
That just seems self-evident.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.180
Pain argues for itself.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:59.000
I think of pain as the fundamental reality because no one disputes it, right?

01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:04.320
Even if you say that you don't believe in pain, it doesn't help when you're in pain.

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:05.820
You still believe in it.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.900
You can't pry it up with logic and rationality.

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:14.180
It just stands forth as a fundament of existence.

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:16.340
And that's actually quite useful to know.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:20.000
You say, well, you don't want any more of that than is absolutely necessary.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.000
And I think that's self-evident.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.340
Then you say, wait a minute, it's more complicated than that.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:31.800
You don't want any more of that than is necessary today, but also not tomorrow and not next week and not next month and not next year.

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:36.820
So however you act now better not compromise how you're going to be in a year.

01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:38.740
Because that'd just be counter-productive.

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:41.620
That's part of of the problem with short-term pleasures, right?

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.480
Act in haste, repent at leisure.

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.420
Everyone knows exactly what that means.

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:51.520
So you have to act in a way that works now and tomorrow and next week and next month and so forth.

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:54.100
And so you have to take your future self into account.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.100
And human beings can do that.

01:18:56.100 --> 01:19:01.040
And taking your future self into account isn't much different than taking other people into account.

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.160
I remember there's this Simpsons episode.

01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:09.920
And Homer downs a quart of mayonnaise and vodka.

01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:12.140
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.120
And he says

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.860
Marge says, you know, you shouldn't really do that.

01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:20.720
And Homer says, that's a problem for future Homer.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:23.980
I'm sure glad I'm not that guy.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:24.880
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:30.180
It's so ridiculous, it caught me, you know?

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:37.500
But you see, we have to grapple with that, and so the you that's out there in the future is sort of like another person.

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:46.800
And so figuring out how to conduct yourself properly in relationship to your future self isn't much different than figuring out how to conduct yourself in relationship to other people.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.100
But then we could expand the constraints.

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:57.740
Not only does the interpretation that you extract have to protect you from suffering and give you an aim, but it has to do it in a way that's inerrable,

01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:05.500
so it works across time, and then it has to work in the presence of other people so that you can cooperate with them and compete with them

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.660
in a way that doesn't make you suffer more.

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:10.900
And people are not that tolerant.

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:14.620
They have choices, they don't have to hang around with you.

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:16.840
They can hang around with any one of these other primates.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:22.940
And so, if you don't act properly, at least within certain boundaries, it's like, you're just cast aside.

01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:30.300
And so people are broadcasting information at you all the time about how you need to interpret the world so they can tolerate being around you.

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:34.620
And you need that because socially isolate, you're insane, and then you're dead.

01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:38.160
No one can tolerate being alone for any length of time.

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:44.120
We can't maintain our own sanity without continual feedback from other people because it's too damn complicated.

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:49.720
So you're constrained by your own existence and then you're constrained by the existence of other people.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.860
And then you're also constrained by the world.

01:20:52.100 --> 01:21:02.800
If I read Hamlet and what I extract out of that is the idea that I should jump off a bridge, it's like it puts my interpretation to an end rather quickly.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.480
It doesn't seem to be optimally functional, let's say.

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:11.500
And so an interpretation is constrained by the reality of the world.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.600
It's constrained by the reality of other people.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:16.560
And it's constrained by your reality across time.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:22.660
There's only a small number of interpretations that are going to work in that tightly defined space.

01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:26.440
And so that's part of the reason that the Post-Modernists are wrong.

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:32.780
It's also part of the reason, by the way, that AI people who've been trying to make intelligent machines have had to put them in a body.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:37.820
Because it turns out you just can't make something intelligent, in some sense, without it being embodied.

01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:40.320
And it's partly for the reasons I just described.

01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:44.000
You need constraints on the system before

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:50.260
you need constraints on the system so that the system doesn't drown in an infinite sea of interpretation.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.800
Something like that.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.200
So that's the literary end of it.

01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:54.900
Moral...

01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:58.460
Well, morality for me is about action.

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:00.780
I'm an existentialist, in some sense.

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:07.040
And what that means is that I believe that what people believe to be true is what they act out, not what they say.

01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:09.700
And so there's lots of definitions of truth.

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.760
I mean, truth is a very expansive word.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:17.280
And you can think of objective truth but behavioral truth isn't the same as objective truth.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.400
What you should do isn't the same as what is,

01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:22.540
as far as I can tell, but people debate that.

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:26.360
But I think the reason that that has to be the case is because...

01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:27.860
Think about it this way.

01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:29.680
You're standing in front of a field.

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:31.980
And you can see the field.

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.720
But the field doesn't tell you how to walk through it.

01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:37.980
There's an infinite number of ways you could walk through it.

01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:45.540
And so you can't extract out an inviolable guide to how you should act from the array of facts that are in front of you.

01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:47.340
Because there's just too many facts.

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:49.540
And they don't have directionality.

01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:51.320
But you, you need to know.

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.140
You need to know how how not to suffer.

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.520
And  you need to know what your aim is.

01:22:55.740 --> 01:23:00.320
And so you have to overlay that objective reality with some interpretive structure.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.460
And it's the nature of that interpretive structure that we're going to be aiming at hard.

01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:06.100
I've given you some hints about it already.

01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:10.980
We've extracted it in part from observations from our own behavior and other peoples' behavior.

01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:17.440
And we've extracted it in part by the nature of our embodiment that's been shaped over hundreds of millions of years.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:23.580
We see the infinite plain of facts and we impose a moral interpretation on it.

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:27.540
And the moral interpretation is what to do about what is.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.900
And that's associated both with security because you just don't need too much complexity,

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.240
And also with aim.

01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:36.140
And so we're mobile creatures, right?

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:37.940
We need to know where we're going.

01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:42.780
Because all we're ever concerned about, roughly speaking, is where we're going.

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.360
That's what we need to know.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.480
Where are we going, what are we doing, and why?

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:51.260
And that's not the same question as what is the world made of objectively.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.840
It's a different question and requires different answers.

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:59.260
And so that's the domain of the moral, as far as I'm concerned, which is what are you aiming at?

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.680
And that's the question of the ultimate ideal, in some sense.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:12.560
Even if you have trivial little fragmentary ideals, there's something trying to emerge out of that that's more coherent and more integrated.

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:15.540
And more applicable and more practical.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.360
And that's the other thing, is that...

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:23.820
You know, you think about literature and you think about art and you think those aren't very tightly tied to the earth.

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:28.300
They're empyrean and airy and spiritual, and they don't seem practical.

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.780
But I'm a practical person.

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:38.340
And part of the reason that I want to assess these books from a literary and aesthetic and evolutionary perspective is

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:43.600
to extract out something of value, something of real value that's practical.

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:48.380
You know? Something, because one of the rules that I have when I'm lecturing is that

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:51.540
I don't want to tell anybody anything that they can't use.

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:53.800
Because I think of knowledge as a tool.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.120
It's something to implement in the world.

01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:59.440
We're tool-using creatures and our knowledge is tools.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.540
And we need tools to work in the world.

01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:07.560
We need tools to regulate our emotions and to make things better and to put an end to suffering to the degree that we can.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:11.300
And to live with ourselves properly, and to stand up properly.

01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:13.280
And you need the tools to do that.

01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:18.280
And so I don't want to do anything in this lecture series that isn't practical.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:24.560
Now I want you to come away having things put together in a way that you can immediately apply it.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:28.560
Not interested in abstraction for the sake of abstraction.

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.040
Rational.

01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:33.460
Well, it's gotta make sense, you know? Because...

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:39.020
the more restrictions on your theory, the better.

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:40.520
And so...

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:49.880
I want it all laid out causally so that B follows A and B precedes C,

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:53.680
and in a way that's understandable and doesn't require a leap

01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:56.340
any unnecessary leap of faith.

01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:03.160
Because that's another thing that I think interferes with our relationship with a collection of books like the Bible.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:07.380
It's that you're called upon to believe things that no one can believe.

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:10.920
And that's not good because that's a form of lie, as far as I can tell.

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:14.880
And then you have to scrap the whole thing because in principle the whole thing is about truth,

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:20.880
and if you have to start your pursuit of truth by swallowing a bunch of lies, then how in the world are you going to get anywhere with that?

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.400
So I don't want any uncertainty at the bottom of this.

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.460
Or I don't want any more than I have to leave in it.

01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:31.760
Because I can't get any farther than that.

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.900
So it's gonna make sense, rationally.

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:42.780
I don't want it to be pushing up against what we know to be scientifically untrue, even though we know that science is in flux.

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:45.900
And that's somewhat of a dangerous parameter.

01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:52.540
If it isn't working with evolutionary theory, for example, then I think that it's not a good enough solution.

01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:53.560
So..

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:57.660
And then, finally, it's phenomenological.

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.000
Modern people, you know, we think of reality as objective.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.280
And that's very powerful.

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:10.100
But that isn't how we experience reality.

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:13.520
We have our domain of experience.

01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:19.420
And this is a hard thing to get a grip on, even though it should be the most obvious thing.

01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:23.100
For the phenomenologist, everything that you experience is real.

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:31.720
And so they're interested in the structure of your subjective experience, and you say well you have subjective experience, and you have subjective experience, and so do you.

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:35.100
And there's commonalities across all of those, like, for example,

01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:38.880
you're likely to experience the same set of emotions.

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.000
We've been able to identify canonical emotions.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.980
And canonical motivations, and without that, we couldn't even communicate because you wouldn't know what the other person was like.

01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:49.920
You'd have to explain infinitely.

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:52.340
There's nothing you can take for granted. But you can.

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:59.760
And phenomenology is the fact that in the center of my vision, my hands are very clear, and then out in the periphery they get.. they disappear.

01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:05.020
And phenomenology is the way things smell and the way things taste, and the fact that they matter.

01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:12.020
And so you could say in some sense that phenomenology is the study of what matters,

01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:13.240
rather than matter.

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:18.340
And it's a given from the phenomenological perspective that things have meaning.

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:26.200
And even if you're a rationalist, say, and a cynic and a nihilist, and you say, well, nothing has any meaning,

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.640
you still run into the problem of pain.

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:32.280
Because pain undercuts your arguments and has a meaning.

01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:38.140
So there's no escaping from the meaning, you can pretty much demolish all the positive parts of it.

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:43.260
But trying to think your way out of the negative parts, man, good luck with that, because that just doesn't work.

01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:44.280
So..

01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:52.320
Phenomenology, and the Bible story is, and I think this is true of fiction in general, is phenomenological.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:02.400
It concentrates on trying to elucidate the nature of human experience, and that is not the same as the objective world.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:08.760
But it's also a form of truth, because it is true that you have a field of experience and that it has qualities.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.720
The question is what are the qualities?

01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:21.840
Now, ancient representations of reality were sort of a weird meld of observable phenomena, the things that we would consider objective facts, and subjective truth,

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.520
the projection of subjective truth.

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.420
And I'll show you, for example,

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:29.480
show you how the Mesopotamians viewed the world.

01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.780
They had a model.

01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:33.500
Basically the world was a disc.

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:37.380
You know, if you go out in a field at night, what does the world look like?

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:38.640
It's a disc.

01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.700
It's got a dome on top.

01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:44.120
Well that was basically the Mesopotamian view of the world.

01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:47.940
And that view of the world that the people who wrote the first stories of the Bible believed too.

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:50.440
And that on top of the dome, there was water.

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:52.500
Well, obviously, it's like, it rains, right?

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:53.620
Where does the water come from?

01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:55.680
Well, there's water around the dome.

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.160
And then there's land, that's the disc.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.780
And then underneath that there's water.

01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:00.900
How do you know that?

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.400
Well, drill! You'll hit water.

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:06.940
It's under the earth, obviously, because how would you hit the water?

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:08.800
And then what's under that? There's fresh water.

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:12.540
And then what's under that? Well, if you go to the edge of the disc, you hit the ocean.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:17.800
It's salt water. So it's a dome, with water outside of it,

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:24.580
and then it's a disc that the dome sits on, and then underneath that there's fresh water, and then underneath that, there's salt water.

01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:27.120
And that was roughly the Mesopotamian world.

01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:32.420
And you see, that's a mix of observation and imagination, right?

01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:36.540
Because that isn't the world, but it is the way the world appears.

01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:39.780
It's a perfectly believable cosmology.

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:44.180
And the sun rises and the sun sets on that dome.

01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:47.380
It's not like the thing's bloody well spinning, who would ever think that up?

01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:53.500
It's obviously the sun goes up and goes down and then travels underneath the world, it comes back up again.

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:55.800
There's nothing more self-evident than that.

01:30:56.180 --> 01:31:05.040
Well, that's that strange intermingling of subjective fantasy, let's say, right at the level of perception, and actual observable phenomena.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:09.860
And a lot of the cosmology that's associated with the Biblical stories is exactly like that.

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:14.920
It's half psychology and half reality.

01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:17.340
Although the psychological is real as well.

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:26.180
And to know that the Biblical stories have a phenomenological truth is really worth knowing because

01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:34.300
you know, the poor fundamentalists, they're trying to cling to their moral structure, and you know, I understand why.

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:39.740
Because it does organize their societies and it organizes their psyche, so they've got something to cling to.

01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:46.060
But you know, they don't have a very sophisticated idea of the complexity of what constitutes truth,

01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:51.780
and they try to gerrymander the Biblical stories into the domain of scientific theory, you know?

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:58.180
Promoting creationism, for example, as an alternative scientific theory.

01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:00.760
It's like, that just isn't going to go anywhere, you know?

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:05.080
Because the people who wrote these damn stories weren't scientists to begin with.

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.160
There weren't any scientists back then.

01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:09.840
There's hardly any scientists now. [LAUGHTER]

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:14.600
You know, it's... really! It's hard to think scientifically, man, it's like, it takes a lot of training.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:18.500
And even scientists don't think scientifically once you get them out of the lab.

01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:20.680
And hardly even when they're in the lab, you know?

01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:25.120
You've got to get peer reviewed and criticized and, like, it's hard to think scientifically.

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:31.040
So however the people who wrote these stories thought was more like dramatists, more like Shakespeare thought.

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:37.580
But that doesn't mean that there isn't truth in it, it just means that you have to be a little bit more sophisticated about your ideas of truth.

01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:39.000
And that's okay, you know?

01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:41.340
There are truths to live by!

01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:47.280
Okay, well, fine, then we want to figure out what those are because we need to live and maybe not to suffer so much.

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:57.560
And so if you know that what the Bible stories and stories in general are trying to represent is the lived experience of conscious individuals,

01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:06.080
like the structure of the lived experience of conscious individuals, then that opens up the possibility of a whole different realm of understanding.

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:14.220
And eliminates the contradiction that's been painful for people, between the objective world and, let's say, the claims of religious stories.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:20.060
Okay, so let's take a look at the structure of the book itself.

01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:23.380
So the first thing about the Bible is that it's a comedy.

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:26.100
And a comedy has a happy ending, right?

01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:31.320
So that's a strange thing because the Greek god stories were almost always tragic.

01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.540
Now, the Bible is a comedy.

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:37.040
It has a happy ending. Everyone lives. There's a heaven.

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:40.940
Now, what you think about that is a completely different issue.

01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:43.060
I'm just telling you the structure of the story.

01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:45.940
It's something like: there was Paradise at the beginning of time,

01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:54.060
and then some cataclysm occurred and people fell into history, and history is limitation and mortality and suffering and self-consciousness.

01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:59.820
But there's a mode of being, or potentially the establishment of the state, that will transcend that.

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.180
And that's what time is aiming at.

01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:05.180
So that's the idea of the story, you know?

01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:10.960
It's a funny thing that the Bible has a story, because it wasn't written as a book, right?

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.860
It was assembled from a whole bunch of different books.

01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:19.000
And the fact that it got assembled into something resembling a story is quite remarkable.

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:24.240
And what the question is then, well what is that story about?

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:26.540
And how did it come up as a story?

01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:28.820
And then, I suppose, as well, is there anything to it?

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:34.480
It constitutes a dramatic record of self-realization or abstraction, I already mentioned that.

01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:43.120
The idea, for example, of the formulation of the, let's say, the image of God, as an abstraction, that's how we're going to handle it to begin with.

01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:49.440
I want to say, though, because I said that I wasn't going to be any more reductionist than necessary,

01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:56.120
I know that the evidence for genuine religious experience is incontrovertible.

01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:58.100
But it's not explicable.

01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:01.900
And so I don't want to explain it away, I want to just leave it, as a fact.

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:06.640
And then I want to pull back from that and say, okay, well we'll leave that as a fact, and a mystery.

01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:16.280
But we're going to look at this from a rational perspective and say that the initial formulation of the idea of God was an attempt to extract out the ideal,

01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:21.760
and to consider it as an abstraction outside its instantiation.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:25.700
And so, that's good enough. That's an amazing thing, if it's true.

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:26.860
But I don't want to

01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:30.400
throw out the baby with the bathwater, let's say.

01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:34.040
It's a collection of books with multiple redactors and editors.

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.300
Well, what does that mean?

01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:36.600
Many people wrote it.

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:38.800
There's many different books.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:42.380
And they're interwoven together, especially in the first five books,

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:46.400
by people who, I suspect, took

01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:53.900
the traditions of tribes that had been brought together under a single political organization,

01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:56.520
and tried to make their accounts coherent.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.280
And so they took a little of this, and they took a little of that, and they took a little of this.

01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:07.520
And they tried not to lose anything, because it seemed valuable, it was certainly valuable to the people who had collected the stories.

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:11.500
They weren't going to, you know, tolerate too much editing.

01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:19.980
But they also wanted it to make sense, to some degree, so it wasn't completely logically contradictory and completely absurd.

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.720
And so, many people wrote it.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:28.180
And many people edited it, and many people assembled it over a vast stretch of time.

01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:30.740
And we have very few documents like that.

01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:42.620
And so just because we have a document like that is sufficient reason to look at it as a remarkable phenomena and try to understand what it is that it's trying to communicate, let's say.

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:47.540
And then I said it's also the world's first hyper-linked text, which is that again.

01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:50.180
And it's very much worth thinking about for quite a long time.

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:57.320
All right. There's four sources, in the Old Testament, or the Hebrew Bible.

01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.700
Four stories that we know came together.

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:02.860
One source was called the Priestly.

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.440
And it used the name Elohim or El Shaddai for God.

01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:10.200
And I believe El is the root word for Allah, as well.

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:21.080
And that's usually translated as God or the gods, because Elohim is utilized as plural in the beginning books of the Bible.

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:24.000
And it's newer that the Jahwist version.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:30.480
Now, the reason I'm telling you that is because Genesis 1, which is the first story, isn't as old as Genesis 2.

01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:35.900
Genesis 2 contains, the Jahwist version, for example, contains the story of Adam and Eve.

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:38.760
And that's older than the very first book in the Bible.

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:41.880
But they decided to put the newer version first.

01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:47.340
And I think it's because it deals with more fundamental abstractions. It's something like that.

01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:55.900
It's like, it deals with the most basic of abstractions, how the universe was created, and then segues into what the human environment is like.

01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:58.380
And so that seems to be the logic behind it.

01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:08.400
The Jahwist version uses the name YHWH, which apparently people didn't say, but we believe was pronounced something like "Yahweh."

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:14.860
And it has a strongly anthropomorphic God, so one that takes human form.

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:17.000
It begins with Genesis 2:4.

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:27.080
This is the account of the heavens and the earth when, and it contains the story of Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel, and Noah, and the Tower of Babel, and Exodus, and Numbers, along with the priestly version.

01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:35.340
It also contains the form, just the form, of the Ten Commandments, which is like a truncated form of the law.

01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:42.820
The Elohist source contains the stories of Abraham and Isaac.

01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:46.640
It's concerned with the heavenly hierarchy that includes angels.

01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:48.620
It talks about the departure from Egypt.

01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:55.340
And it presents the Covenant Code, which is this idea that society is predicated (this was Israeli society),

01:38:55.340 --> 01:39:01.180
was predicated on a covenant with God, and that's laid out in a sequence of rules, some of which are the Ten Commandments,

01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:04.080
but many of which are much more extensive than that.

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:12.200
And then the final one is the Deuteronomist code, and it contains the bulk of the law, and the Deuteronomic history.

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:16.260
And it's independent of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers.

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:24.620
And so we know that at least for, now there's debate  about this, like there is about everything, so I'm brushing over a very large area of scholarship,

01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:34.620
but people generally assume that there were multiple authors over multiple periods of time, and the way they concluded that is by looking at textual analysis, you know?

01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:40.920
Trying to see where there are chunks of the stories that have the same kind of style or the same referents.

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:46.320
And people argue about that because, you know, obviously it's difficult to recreate something ancient.

01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:48.920
But that's the basic idea.

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:53.780
So it is an amalgam of viewpoints about these initial issues.

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:55.380
And that's important to know.

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:58.780
So it's like a collective story.

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:05.320
Okay, now, to understand the first part of Genesis,

01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:07.380
I'm going to turn,

01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:11.880
strangely enough, to

01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:19.060
something that's actually part of the New Testament, and this is a central element of Christianity.

01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:24.060
And it's a very strange idea and it's going to take a very long time to unpack.

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:29.980
But the idea, this is what John said about Christ, he said "in the beginning was the Word."

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:36.840
So that relates back to Genesis 1, "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."

01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:45.620
That's some, well, three sentences like that take a lot of unpacking because, well none of that seems to make any sense whatsoever, really, right?

01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:50.080
In the beginning was the word. And, the word was both with God. And, the word was God.

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:53.840
So, the first question might be, what in the world does that mean?

01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:57.320
In the beginning was the word, that's the logos actually.

01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:04.320
And the logos is embodied in the figure of Christ. So there's this idea in John that whatever Christ is, the son of God,

01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:11.620
is not only instantiated in history, say, at a particular time and place, as a carpenter in some backwoods part of the world,

01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:13.440
but also, something eternal

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:17.580
that exists up, outside of time and space, that was there right at the beginning.

01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:22.740
And as far as I can tell, what that logos represents is something like modern people,

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:27.240
something like what modern people refer to when they talk about consciousness.

01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:35.040
It's something like that. It's more than that. It's like consciousness and its capacity to be aware and its capacity to communicate.

01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:43.140
It's something like that, and there's an idea underneath that, which is that being, especially from a phenomenological perspective, so the being that is experience,

01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:45.160
can not exist without consciousness.

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.980
It's like consciousness shines a light on things to bring it into being.

01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:53.460
Because without consciousness, what is there?

01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:55.460
No one experiences anything.

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:59.160
Is there anything when no one experiences anything?

01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:00.500
That's the question.

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:08.120
And the answer that this book is presenting is that, no, you have to think about consciousness as a constituent element of reality.

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:12.580
It's something that's necessary for reality itself to exist.

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:15.580
Now, of course, it depends on what you mean by reality.

01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:23.100
But, the reality that's being referred to here, I told you already, is the strange amalgam of the subjective experience and the world.

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:30.880
But the question is deeper than that too, because it is by no means obvious what there is if there's no one to experience it.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.760
I mean the whole notion of time itself seems to collapse, at least in terms of something like felt duration.

01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:42.660
And the notion of size disappears, essentially, because there's nothing to scale it.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.840
Causality seems to vanish.

01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:50.040
We don't understand consciousness. Not in the least.

01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:55.660
We don't understand what it is that is in us that gives illumination to being.

01:42:55.660 --> 01:43:01.880
And what happens in the Old Testament, at least in part, is that that consciousness is associated with the divine.

01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:06.180
Now you think, well, is that a reasonable proposition?

01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:12.420
That's a very complicated question, but at least we might know that there's something to the claim.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Because there is a miracle of experience and existence that's dependent on consciousness.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.420
I mean, people try to explain it away constantly, but it doesn't seem to work very well.

01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:26.580
And here's something else to think about, I think, that's really worth thinking about.

01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:30.320
People do not like it when you treat them like they're not conscious.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.080
Right? They react very badly to that.

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:36.880
And you don't like it if someone assumes that you're not conscious,

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:40.180
and you don't like it if someone assumes that you don't have free will.

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:46.820
You know, that you're just absolutely determined in your actions, and there's nothing that's going to repair you.

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:49.420
And that you don't need to have any responsibility for your actions.

01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:56.100
It's like our culture, the laws of our culture, are predicated on the idea, something like, people are conscious,

01:43:56.100 --> 01:44:02.800
people have experience, people make decisions and can be held responsible for them, if there's a free will element to it.

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.200
And you can debate all that philosophically, and fine.

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:12.300
But the point is that that is how we act and that is the ideal that our legal system is predicated on.

01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:18.240
And there's something deep about it, because you're a subject to the law.

01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:21.700
But the law is also limited by you.

01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:28.040
Which is to say that in a well-functioning, properly-grounded democratic system,

01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:31.680
you have intrinsic value.

01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.720
That's the source of your rights, even if you're a murderer.

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:41.300
We have to say, the law can only go so far because there's something about you that's divine.

01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:43.100
Well, what does that mean?

01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:49.980
Well, partly it means that there's something about you that's conscious and capable of communicating, like you're a whole world unto yourself.

01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:53.740
And you have that to contribute to everyone else and that's valuable.

01:44:53.740 --> 01:45:00.740
That you can learn new things, you can transform the structure of society, you can invent a new way of dealing with the world.

01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:02.380
You're capable of all that.

01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:05.800
It's an intrinsic part of you, and that's associated with this.

01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:11.240
That's the idea there, is that there's something about the logos

01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:21.020
that is necessary for the absolute chaos of the reality beyond experience to manifest itself as reality.

01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:27.540
That's an amazing idea because it gives consciousness a constitutive role in the cosmos.

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:32.640
And you can debate that, but, you know, you can't just bloody well brush it off.

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:40.780
Because, first of all, we are the most complicated things there are that we know of, by a massive amount.

01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:43.060
We're so complicated that it's unbelievable.

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:48.380
And so, you know, there's a lot of cosmos out there, but there's a lot of cosmos in here too.

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:56.800
And which one is greater is by no means obvious, unless you use something trivial, like relative size, which, you know, really isn't a very sophisticated approach.

01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:05.440
And whatever it is that is you has this capacity to experience reality and to transform it, which is a very strange thing, you know?

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:08.920
You can conceptualize a future, in your imagination.

01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:11.600
And then you can work and make that manifest.

01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:14.300
You participate in the process of creation.

01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:16.000
That's one way of thinking about it.

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:25.240
And so that's why I think, in Genesis 1, it relates the idea that human beings are made in the image of the divine, men and women,

01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:35.040
which is interesting too, because the feminists are always criticizing Christianity, for example, as being inexorably patriarchal.

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:40.880
Of course, they criticize everything like that [LAUGHTER], so it's hardly a stroke of bloody brilliance.

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:49.320
But I think it's an absolute miracle that right at the beginning of the document, it says straightforwardly, with no hesitation whatsoever,

01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:57.580
that the divine spark, which we're associating with the word that brings forth being, is manifest in men and women equally.

01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:59.220
That's a very cool thing.

01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:03.600
And you've gotta think, like I said, you actually take that seriously.

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:07.340
Well, what you've got to ask is, what happens if you don't take it seriously?

01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:08.320
Right?

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:12.200
Read Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment."

01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:13.660
That's the best...

01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:20.200
the best investigation of that tactic that's ever been produced

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:26.600
Because what happens in Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment" is that the main character, whose name is Raskolnikov,

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:29.700
decides that there's no intrinsic value to other people.

01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:32.140
And that as a consequence, he can do whatever he wants.

01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:34.480
It's only cowardice that stops him from acting.

01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:41.960
Right? Because, well, why would it be anything else if the value of other people is just an arbitrary superstition?

01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:44.580
Then why can't I do exactly what I want, when I want?

01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:46.800
Which is the psychopath's viewpoint.

01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:52.780
Well, so Roskolnikov does. He kills someone who's a very horrible person, and he has very good reasons for killing her.

01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:58.260
He's half starved and a little bit insane, and possessed by this ideology, it's a brilliant, brilliant layout.

01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:08.120
And he finds out something after he kills her, which is that the post-killing Raskolnikov and the pre-killing Raskolnikov are not the same person, even a little bit.

01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:12.820
Because he's broken a rule, like he's broken a serious rule, and there's no going back.

01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:23.300
And "Crime and Punishment" is the best investigation I know of, of what happens if you take the notion that there's nothing divine about the individual seriously.

01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:24.420
Now you...

01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:35.740
Most of the people I know who are deeply atheistic, and I understand why they're deeply atheistic, they haven't contended with people like Dostoevsky.

01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:37.000
Not as far as I can tell.

01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:40.280
Because I don't see logical flaws in "Crime and Punishment."

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:42.280
I think he got the psychology exactly right.

01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:45.560
Dostoevsky's amazing for this because

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:48.000
in one of his books, "The Devils," for example,

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:53.360
he describes a political scenario that's not much different than the one we find ourselves in now.

01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:58.440
And there are these people who are possessed by rationalistic, utopian, atheistic ideas.

01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:01.740
They're very powerful. They gave rise to the Communist Revolution.

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:03.620
Right? I mean, they're powerful ideas.

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:13.620
His character, Stavrogin, also acts out the presupposition that human beings have no intrinsic nature and no intrinsic value.

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:23.360
And it's another brilliant investigation. And Dostoevsky prophesized, that's what I would say, what will happen to a society if it goes down that road.

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.620
And he was dead exactly accurate.

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:31.060
It's uncanny to read Dostoevsky's "The Possessed" or the "The Devils," depending on the translation,

01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:34.380
and then to read Alexander Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag Archipelago"

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:42.500
because one is fiction and prophecy and the second  is hey look it turned out exactly the same way that Dostoevsky said it would for exactly the same reasons

01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:44.040
So it's quite remarkable.

01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:54.800
So, the question is: Do you contend seriously with the idea that, A: there's something cosmically constitutive about consciousness,

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:58.540
and B: that that might well be considered divine,

01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:01.780
and C: that that is instantiated in every person.

01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:06.540
And then ask yourself, if you're not a criminal, if you don't act it out?

01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:11.160
And then ask yourself what that means. Is that reflective of a reality?

01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:16.960
Is it a metaphor? Like, maybe it's a metaphor, a complex metaphor that we have to use to organize our societies.

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:24.480
It could well be, but even as a metaphor it's true enough so that we mess with it at our peril.

01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:27.700
And it also took people a very long time to figure out.

01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:31.020
This is Genesis 1.

01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:35.980
You know what, I'm probably going to stop there because I believe it's 9:30

01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:38.600
And so we didn't even get to the first line.

01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:40.740
[LAUGHTER]

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:47.640
[APPLAUSE]

01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:51.080
[LAUGHTER]

01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:51.960
Yeah, yeah.

01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:56.860
Look, I want to read you a couple of things that we'll use as a prodroma for the next lexture

01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:02.540
I'll just bounce through a collection of ideas that's associated with the notion of divinity

01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:06.540
And then we'll turn back to the first lines when we start the next lecture.

01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:10.000
I have no idea how far I'm going to get through the biblical stories, by the way.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:10.500
[LAUGHTER]

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:13.040
Because I'm trying to figure this out as I go along.

01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:20.480
There's an idea in Christianity that the image of God is trinity, right?

01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:25.600
There's the Father, there's the element of the Father, there's the element of the Son, and there's the element of the Holy Spirit.

01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:29.400
And something like tradition, the spirit of tradition,

01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:35.020
it's something like the human being as the newest incarnation of that tradition.

01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:37.300
Like the living incarnation of that tradition.

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:44.560
And then it's something like the spirit in people that makes the relationship with this and this possible.

01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:45.920
The spirit in individuals.

01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:53.780
So I'm going to bounce my way quickly through some of the classical, metaphorical attributes of God,

01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:57.020
so that we kind of have a cloud of notions about what we're talking about

01:51:57.020 --> 01:52:03.280
when we return to Genesis 1 and talk about the God who spoke chaos into being.

01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:09.820
So there's a fatherly aspect. So here's what God as a father is like.

01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:13.940
You can enter into a covenant with it. You can make a bargain with it.

01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:19.400
Now you think about that. Money is like that. Because money is a bargain you make with the future.

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:24.560
So we've structured our world so that you can negotiate with the future.

01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:30.340
And I don't think that we would've got to the point where we could do that without having this idea to begin with.

01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:33.340
You can act as if the future is a reality.

01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:38.220
There's a spirit of tradition that enables you to act as if the future is something that can be bargained with.

01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:40.220
That's why you make sacrifices.

01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:46.060
Sacrifices were acted out for a very long period of time and now they're psychological.

01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:54.160
We know that you can sacrifice something valuable 
 in the present and expect that you're negotiating with something that represents the transcendent future.

01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:57.600
And that's an amazing human discovery.

01:52:57.660 --> 01:53:01.000
Like, no other creature can do that, to act as if the future is real.

01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:07.240
To note that you can bargain with reality itself and that you can do it successfully. It's unbelievable.

01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:09.080
It responds to sacrifice.

01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:10.840
It answers prayers.

01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:13.740
I'm not saying that any of this is true, by the way.

01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:17.160
I'm just saying what the cloud of ideas represents.

01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:22.800
It punishes and rewards. It judges and forgives. It's not Nature.

01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:30.560
One of the things that's weird about the Judeo-Christian tradition is that God and Nature are not the same thing at all.

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:35.740
Whatever God is, partially manifest in this logos, is something that stands outside of nature.

01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:41.300
And I think that's something like consciousness as abstracted from the natural world.

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:46.280
It built Eden for makind and then banished us for disobedience.

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:47.880
It's too powerful to be touched.

01:53:48.620 --> 01:53:50.020
It granted free will.

01:53:50.020 --> 01:53:53.560
Distance from it is is Hell. Distance from it is Death.

01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:57.600
It reveals itself in dogma and in mystical experience.

01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:58.860
And it's the Law.

01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:01.200
So that's sort of like the Fatherly aspect.

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:03.440
And then the Son-like aspect.

01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:08.720
It speaks chaos into order. It slays dragons and feeds people with the remains.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:11.000
It finds gold. It rescues virgins.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.140
It's the body and blood of Christ.

01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:18.720
It's the tragic victim and scapegoat and eternally triumphant redeemer simultaneously.

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:20.240
It cares for the outcast.

01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:21.940
It dies and is reborn.

01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:24.900
It's the King of kinds and Hero of heroes.

01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:29.760
It's not the state, but is both the fulfillment and critic of the state.

01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:32.020
It dwells in the perfect house.

01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:34.280
It is aiming at Paradise or Heaven.

01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:35.960
It can rescue from Hell.

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.760
It cares for the outcast.

01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:41.140
It's the foundation stone and the cornerstone that was rejected.

01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:43.340
And it's the spirit of the Law.

01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:47.060
And then it's spirit-like.

01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:49.480
It's akin to the human soul.

01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:51.740
It's the prophetic voice.

01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:54.580
It's the still, small voice of conscience.

01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:56.120
It's the spoken truth.

01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:58.180
It's called forth by music.

01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:02.040
It is the enemy of deceit, arrogance, and resentment.

01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:03.720
It's the water of life.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.600
It burns without consuming.

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:07.340
And it's a blinding light.

01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:13.040
Okay, so that's a very well-developed, poetic set of poetic metaphors, essentially, right?

01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:20.340
So these are all glimpses of the transcendent ideal, that's the right way of thinking about it.

01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:22.820
Glimpses of the transcendent ideal.

01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:25.160
And all of them have a specific meaning.

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:31.520
And well, in part, what we're going to do is go over that meaning as we continue with this series.

01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:33.080
And so what we've got now

01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:39.140
is a brief description, at least, of what this is.

01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:42.440
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:46.040
We know it's associated with the logos in this sequence of stories.

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.780
We know it's associated with the Word and with consciousness.

01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:51.560
And we know that it's associated with

01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:53.140
whatever God is.

01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:58.180
And then I laid the metaphoric landscape that, at least in part, describes God.

01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:01.340
And so now we have some sense of the being that does this:

01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:03.140
creates the heavens and the earth.

01:56:03.340 --> 01:56:05.180
The earth was without form, and void.

01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:08.640
That's that chaotic state of intermingled confusion.

01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:11.040
The darkness was over the face of the deep.

01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:13.880
And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:17.500
And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.

01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:19.400
And so we'll stop with that.

01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:26.180
Because now we're ready to take a tentative step into the very first part of this book.

01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:35.820
And it's important to have your conceptual framework properly organized so that you can appreciate where it's going and what it might possibly mean.

01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:43.260
And so, well, I've done what I can today to, what would you say, elaborate on this single word, I suppose.

01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:45.060
[LAUGHTER]

01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:47.000
But it's a big word, you know?

01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:53.480
It's not so unreasonable that it takes a long time to get to the point where you have any sense of what it means at all.

01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:56.700
All right.

01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:01.980
That is nowhere near... I thought that I would get a LOT farther than that.

01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:03.200
[LAUGHTER]

01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:03.700
All right.

01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:05.180
So thank you very much.

01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:25.760
[APPLAUSE]

01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:30.360
So we do have time for some questions. We have to be out of here at 10:30.

01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:37.180
It's 9:30, so maybe we'll have questions until someone crazy grabs the microphone and [LAUGHS]

01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:40.480
Or maybe we'll have questions for half an hour, something like that.

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:45.100
So, if anybody has any questions, then, there's a microphone there, and there's a microphone there.

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:51.740
I'll try to answer them, to the best that I can. The best of my ability.

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:54.980
Let's start.

01:57:56.100 --> 01:58:07.740
Okay, so you talked about the idea of when you're confronting something that you fear, you face it head on and you destroy it.

01:58:08.180 --> 01:58:16.740
But then you said that the idea is when you're confronting something, you make the world out of it, and I was wondering if you could just generally expound on what that means.

01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:20.720
You make your marriage out of the arguments.

01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:21.540
Okay.

01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:25.040
You know, you have arguments with your wife, you have arguments with you children.

01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:26.860
That's that chaotic state.

01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:34.440
Because no one's been able to formulate a habitable order from that domain of controversy and confusion.

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:39.220
And then, through dialogue, you erect a structure that's a house that you can both live in.

01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:43.660
And so that's the idea, of making the world out of that chaos.

01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:51.720
And it's frightening because if you really, this is why people often avoid having disputes with people they love, because it's frightening, right?

01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:54.500
You find out what the person's like and you find out what you're like.

01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:56.280
It's like, god, who wants to do that?

01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:57.000
Nobody.

01:58:57.620 --> 01:59:02.400
And so, your heart rate goes up, and it's confrontation and conflict.

01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:09.120
And that's because you're encountering that domain that hasn't been properly mapped or configured.

01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:14.160
And you're doing that with your predator-detection systems, essentially.

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:23.220
And so that chaos that threatens the stability, say, of the marriage, is equivalent to, well, it's equivalent to the serpent in the tree, that's one form of equivalence.

01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:29.020
And then, by dialogue and negotiation, you formulate the problem.

01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:30.640
What exactly's going on here?

01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:31.860
Where exactly are we?

01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:33.500
What exactly is the problem?

01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:39.580
And so you keep talking until you reach a consensus about that, one that you can live with, one that you can act out.

01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:45.220
Right? And maybe you come up with the solution to the problem, and you've established peace again.

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:47.940
Peace, that's the house that you can both live in.

01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:53.160
And that's the chaos that people can fall into all the time, and often do.

01:59:53.280 --> 02:00:00.300
And it's the chaos that makes a marriage wash up on the shores and transform into, like, fifteen year divorce court.

02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:01.980
A very horrible thing.

02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:04.180
So, that's the idea.

02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:06.120
Okay, thank you.

02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:06.720
Okay.

02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:10.920
[APPLAUSE]

02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:16.300
Hi Dr. Peterson, thank you so much for the talk and thanks for your teachings.

02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:23.460
It's really helped me a lot. I had an experience in grad school, two English degrees, and the way you described the humanities, in my experience,

02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:27.140
helped me understand my experience back then.

02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:27.820
So thank you.

02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:34.100
That's too bad, that's too bad that that happens to be the case. Really, you know, that's not good.

02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:35.500
[LAUGHTER]

02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:37.120
You don't have to tell me that.

02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:37.780
Yep.

02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:40.280
But, you know, I survived, and I learned a lot

02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:40.780
Yep.

02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:45.220
And I'm not ungrateful for my experience, I've learned a lot.

02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:51.460
But you said something, you described the collection of stories in the Bible in an interesting way, and I wondered if it was on purpose.

02:00:51.700 --> 02:01:02.340
You described it as an assembly of stories created by many people, over time, that's hyper-linked, into itself.

02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:07.820
And it sounds a lot like a description of how the Internet works.

02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:14.960
Yeah, well it's not accidental, because the Internet's also a collective endeavor.

02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:17.920
God only knows what personality it's going to manifest.

02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:23.300
But it's going to manifest some personality because it's learning to understand us very, very rapidly.

02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:29.020
So I think there's no reason not to think about it as a pre-cursor.

02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:34.880
The distance between the Bible and the Internet is a lot less than the distance between a chimpanzee and a human being.

02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:46.960
And the difference between a book and the Internet is also, in some sense it's a matter of degree rather than kind.

02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:59.760
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:05.800
I can't speculate, because God only knows what's going to happen in the next twenty years.

02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:06.860
I certainly don't.

02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:11.540
I don't know what the pre-conditions are for consciousness. I have no idea.

02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:13.420
And I don't think anybody knows.

02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:15.540
So, I guess we're gonna find out.

02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:18.420
Yep.

02:02:19.300 --> 02:02:24.060
[APPLAUSE]

02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:25.560
Hi Dr. Peterson.

02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:31.140
I'm curious about the connection between aesthetic  beauty and religious experience.

02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:34.740
I think you've hinted at it once or twice over the course of this lecture.

02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:46.280
Is it possible for something that's incredibly beautiful to evoke a religious or mystical experience, or something in the same ballpark?

02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:47.820
I think that's what they're for.

02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:52.500
If you look at the structure of a Renaissance cathedral,

02:02:53.060 --> 02:03:06.200
That's literally what I was just going to... that's my tag-on question to the next part was is that why we have cathedrals built like a spectacular buildings, as opposed to...

02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:15.440
Yeah, well if you're going to house the ultimate ideal, you build something beautiful to represent its dwelling place.

02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:16.580
And it should be beautiful.

02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:19.360
And this is something that people do not take seriously.

02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:22.420
This is especially something we don't take seriously in Canada.

02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:29.840
I mean, you think about all the hundreds of millions of dollars that were invested into beauty in Europe.

02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:39.000
I mean, spectacular, excessive investment in beauty that's paid back God only knows how many multiples of times.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:45.320
People make pilgrimages to Europe constantly because it's so beautiful that it just staggers you.

02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:48.640
Beauty is so valuable, and we're so afraid of it.

02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:56.040
And I think we're afraid of it because it's a pathway, it's not the only pathway to the divine, I mean, there's pathways to the divine.

02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:58.400
Love is one of them, I suppose.

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:03.220
But beauty, especially for people who have an affinity for beauty, it's like music.

02:04:03.220 --> 02:04:05.880
It's one of those things that we can't argue against, right?

02:04:06.220 --> 02:04:08.560
You can't even understand, it just hits you.

02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:14.480
And it shows you the ideal, that's one way to think about it.

02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:19.260
But it also shows you, I think, it's like a vision of the potential future.

02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:20.640
It's something like that as well.

02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:25.860
That if we just got our act together and beautified things, that that's the place the we could inhabit.

02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:31.840
And that would ennoble us, and that's why Jerusalem, the heavenly city, is paved with gemstones, you know?

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:37.820
They're crystalline, they emit light, it's the proper dwelling place for an enlightened consciousness.

02:04:37.820 --> 02:04:41.060
Beauty is the proper dwelling place for an enlightened consciousness.

02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:45.980
And we ignore it at our spiritual and economic peril.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.200
It's obvious that beauty, there's almost nothing more valuable than beauty.

02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:53.260
Economically, practically, right?

02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:54.580
So, yeah.

02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:59.920
Why that is, who knows?

02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:01.500
You know?

02:05:01.940 --> 02:05:06.840
Why we experience gemstones, for example, as beautiful, it's very mysterious.

02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:08.540
There're deep reasons for it.

02:05:11.380 --> 02:05:16.260
[APPLAUSE]

02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:16.760
Hi.

02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:19.180
I have a bit of a similar question, actually.

02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:28.660
I know that one of the ways in which the Bible is appreciated, even by some of its harshest critics and deeply atheistic people,

02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:36.160
is as a work of literature and as something, at least the King James authorized translation of the Bible, as something very aesthetically beautiful.

02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:39.400
And a great work of literature and a great work of poetry.

02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:53.700
And I'm wondering, just from your study of it, and from your personal perspective, if there's any particular passages or parts of it that have struck you that way, or that you cherish more than any others, that you would be able to share.

02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:59.780
Well the ones that have really opened up to me, I think, are the stories in Genesis.

02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:08.500
Right up to the Tower of Babel, because I think, well, and hopefully I'll talk to all of you about that, but I think I've got some sense of what they mean and why.

02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:11.600
I know it's not exhaustive, obviously, but

02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:14.460
the story in Exodus as well.

02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:17.160
I also feel like I've got a handle on that.

02:06:17.460 --> 02:06:20.420
And so those have hit me really, really hard.

02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:27.460
And just trying to understand this first part of Genesis, to try to understand what these concepts mean has been

02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:36.940
Especially when I started to understand that the concept that human beings are made in God's image, that God has all those attributes that we just described,

02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:44.300
that human beings are made in God's image, that that's actually the cornerstone of our legal system, that really rattled me.

02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:54.300
Because I didn't understand that clearly, that our body of laws has that metaphysical presupposition, without which the laws fall apart.

02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:56.100
And that's starting to happen, it really is.

02:06:56.100 --> 02:06:58.380
You know, like the post-modern critique of law.

02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:09.280
The law schools are, I would say, they're overrun by post-modernists who are undermining the structure of Western law as fast as they possibly can because they don't buy any of this.

02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:18.980
And so they're much more likely to just think of the law as something, like a casual pragmatic tool to be manipulated for the purposes of bringing forth the utopia.

02:07:19.180 --> 02:07:22.140
It's a really, really, really bad idea.

02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:29.120
So it's very strange to me that we go off track when that metaphysical foundation starts to get rattled.

02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:36.640
Do you think your appreciation of the aesthetic beauty of it comes from a belief in the truth in the underlying proposition?

02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:53.380
I mean, that's, because even the atheistic critics that I'm thinking of, like, even Dawkins or Hitchens, really appreciate the Bible as just a piece of really beautiful literature and just the quality of the writing, even if they totally reject the premise of it.

02:07:53.560 --> 02:08:07.840
Yeah, well I don't think that you can see it as beautiful and poetic AND reject the underlying premises because if you see it as beautiful and poetic, you're accepting the underlying premises with your experience of the beauty and the poetics,

02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:11.640
even though you may be fighting it with your articulated rationality.

02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:16.920
So I that indicates is a dis-integrated perspective on the book.

02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:26.620
And it's not surprising that that's the case, it's the perspective that everyone has on the book, except with them it's more well-developed and well-thought-through.

02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:29.080
But I think it's fundamentally...

02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:33.760
They're not approaching the thing with enough respect, that's my sense.

02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:36.780
And who knows, right? I don't know.

02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:41.120
But what I've tried to do is to think there's probably more to this than I know.

02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:50.300
And then tried to understand it from that perspective, rather than to think, for example, well, it's a collection of superstitions that we've somehow outgrown.

02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:55.300
It's like, no, sorry, that's not a deep enough analysis.

02:08:55.820 --> 02:09:06.340
Because it's got some truth, but it doesn't take into account the fact that the propositions still stand at the foundation of our culture.

02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:13.140
It doesn't address Nietzsche's central concern, which is that if you blow out the notion of God, the entire structure crumbles.

02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:21.500
You can debate that, fine. But I'd just as soon that you debated it with Nietzsche, because he's a pretty tough customer to tangle with.

02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:29.460
I don't think the atheist types, insofar as there's a type, I don't think they've wrestled with the real problems.

02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:31.360
Yeah.

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:38.100
[APPLAUSE]

02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:44.220
So I appreciate you set up some ground rules to keep things rational, and I think that's going to help us.

02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:54.640
What I'm wondering is, so for instance, you said elsewhere, the New Testament, from what you can see, it's psychologically correct.

02:09:54.780 --> 02:10:02.140
And that's quite astounding, I would say. There's a lot of truth in your depiction to these stories, elsewhere.

02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:06.280
You've pointed out deep truths, real powerful.

02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:21.020
So what my question would be is if we can say Nietzsche took an order of magnitude of intelligence and depth to be able to predict what would happen in the next century,

02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:27.660
rationally, if the Bible's not the inerrant word of God, what's going on?

02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:29.760
That's a good question.

02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:34.160
That's a really good question, and I'm going to try that rationally.

02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:44.620
But, as I said, I don't want to leave people with the notion, because you know, some ways, this is something I've been thinking about a long time,

02:10:44.620 --> 02:10:50.520
is I can't tell if I'm an advocate of the religious viewpoint or its worst possible critic.

02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:55.720
Because I am doing my best to make it rational, and there's a reductionistic element to that.

02:10:55.720 --> 02:11:00.920
But I think that I'm doing that while also leaving the door open to things that I don't understand.

02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:06.040
Because that there's more to this story than I understand or can understand.

02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:14.440
And I'm laying out what I can understand and I'm making it rational, but I do not believe for an instant that that exhausts the realm.

02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:21.480
It's like there are ways of interpreting these stories that work in the conceptual universe we inhabit right now.

02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:24.640
But there's a lot of things that we don't understand.

02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:29.920
One thing I found about digging into these stories is that the deeper you dig, the more you find.

02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:35.200
And that's one of the things that convinced me that there was more to them than I had originally suspected.

02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:39.760
Because things would click, and I'd think, wow, that's really something.

02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:46.220
And then I would take it apart further, and I'd think, oh, well, I thought THAT was something, but this is even more remarkable.

02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:48.080
It just keeps opening and opening.

02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:58.720
So I'm gonna make it rational. I'm going to try to provide an answer to, and I think you're right about speaking about Nietzsche and his capacity for prophecy, and Dostoevsky's in the same category.

02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:06.020
It's like there are prophetic elements to the Old and New Testament that seem to stretch over much vaster spans of time.

02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:09.400
And I'm going to try to produce a rational account of that.

02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:19.940
But, I mean, one of the reasons that I think the New Testament is "psychologically true," let's say, is because, and this is one of the things that's deeply embedded in the structure of the Bible.

02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:28.660
In the Old Testament, there's this idea, and I'm skipping ahead, that through a succession of states,

02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:33.880
the people who behave properly will eventually establish the proper state.

02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:38.480
And so the state is viewed, in some sense, as the entity of salvation.

02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:44.140
But what happens in the New Testament is that idea gets, you could say, deconstructed.

02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:52.080
And instead of a state being the place of redemption, a state of being becomes the test of redemption.

02:12:52.220 --> 02:13:01.720
And so the idea that human beings will be redeemed moves from the utopian state vision to the responsibility of the individual.

02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:03.420
And I think that's correct.

02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:11.840
I believe that that's the right answer, and I think that the West, in particular, is predicated on that idea.

02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:15.560
Because it makes the state subservient to the individual.

02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:25.400
I mean there's a continual dialogue, but in the final analysis the locus of the divine is the individual and not the state.

02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:32.620
And I believe that's so true that if we don't act it out and believe it, then we all die painfully.

02:13:32.620 --> 02:13:34.300
And that's true enough for me.

02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:35.020
So.

02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:41.260
[APPLAUSE]

02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:43.540
I thank you for the illuminating talk.

02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:52.160
I'm going to keep you on the creation story, and if you don't mind, because we know this editing that was done, there was a purpose for the editing.

02:13:52.300 --> 02:14:05.180
Can you give us your thoughts about the differences in the story of creation, especially pertaining to man, from the first chapter, which is very God-like, you know, by a word?

02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:10.360
And to the second one, which is more like a fatherly type of creation.

02:14:10.380 --> 02:14:16.660
Is it the selling point? What was the reason for this type of editing to put the two together, one of them?

02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:34.140
Well, I think that the more cynical criticisms of the Bible and the religious tradition, for instances like Marxists or Freudsian, for that matter, make the case that it's a manifestation of power and politics.

02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:39.500
And that there's always a political or economic motivation behind the construction of the stories.

02:14:39.500 --> 02:14:41.960
And I think that that's true to some degree.

02:14:42.220 --> 02:14:49.600
But I don't think that it's true enough so that you can take that particular interpretive tack and be done with it.

02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:58.740
And I would say that to the degree that there are political and economic motivations that have shaped the stories, the fact that multiple stories have come together,

02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:10.240
they're sort of corrective in some sense, and so even if at the level of detail, there's political intrigue and politics, say, with regards to the ascendancy of Israel,

02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:15.900
when you step away from it, it becomes something that's more universal and escapes from that.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.680
And how that happened, I don't know.

02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:26.560
I mean, I think it's safe to say, it's reasonably safe to say that the people who put this document together, they did two things.

02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:30.980
I think they were guided by their aesthetic taste and their conscience.

02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:32.420
I truly believe that.

02:15:32.420 --> 02:15:38.900
And the reason I believe that is because I think anything that was propagandistic would have been forgotten.

02:15:39.580 --> 02:15:41.380
Because you can't remember propaganda.

02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:45.580
No one likes it, it's like it's dead ten years after you write it, or twenty years.

02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:51.620
And it isn't only that these books were assembled and written, it was that they were preserved and remembered.

02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:55.340
And to me that means they have an affinity with the structure of memory.

02:15:55.340 --> 02:16:01.000
I mean, you think about it. How does the story last ten thousand years unless it's the kind of story you can remember?

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.940
It doesn't, because you forget all the forgettable stuff.

02:16:03.940 --> 02:16:06.100
And all you remember is the memorable stuff.

02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:15.780
And so there's this interplay between the document itself and its audience that shapes the document.

02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:21.180
Now, I don't know how specifically I answered your question.

02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:30.800
We're going to hit the different stories as they come up in sequence and I think I'll shed some more light on the relationship between them doing that.

02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:32.480
And we'll start with that next week.

02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:38.720
[APPLAUSE]

02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:48.000
Right, so um I've been really interested in a lot of the stuff that you've been saying about dreams because I've been lucid dreaming a lot for many years.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:52.400
But always in a sort of atheistic way, as sort of like a game or something like that.

02:16:52.660 --> 02:17:05.760
But because of seeing your talks and everything, I've started to think of it from a different perspective, like you're now interfacing with something beyond the narrow scope of your conscious awareness, or something like that.

02:17:05.820 --> 02:17:07.820
Maybe mythological or something like God.

02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:23.080
And so what I've been thinking about, and what I've maybe wondered what you'd think about, is that, in some ways, when you're lucid dreaming, you're getting beyond the limitations of a normal dreamer, sort of transcending limitations,

02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:27.580
which maybe is not the purpose of people, right?

02:17:27.580 --> 02:17:33.080
Because as a person, you're supposed to be limited in some ways, as opposed to God, who's not limited.

02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:41.340
And how, but on the other hand, it's a good opportunity to kind of have control over your interactions with this very special, interesting thing.

02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:48.780
So I guess the conundrum is that on one hand, you can control your interactions, but on the other hand, you ARE controlling them.

02:17:48.780 --> 02:17:55.440
So I guess I'm wondering what you think about that, and also just in general what do you think about lucid dreaming as a thing, like, should you do it?

02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:57.840
I had a client who could really lucid dream, you know?

02:17:58.380 --> 02:18:04.080
And one of the things, she used them now and then to solve problems, even though she didn't always pay attention to the answer.

02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:05.340
Sometimes she did.

02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:14.040
In one of her dreams, one of the characters told her that she would have to learn to live with a slaughterhouse.

02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:20.120
She was very afraid of life, and one of the consequences of that was that we went and watched them bombing.

02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:26.840
So but one of the things she did, she'd ask the characters what they were up to, you know?

02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:29.740
She was, instead of controlling, she would inquire.

02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:34.160
And so but I don't know what to say about lucid dreaming beyond that.

02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:41.040
I know it's a well-documented phenomena and many people can do it, and women seem to be able to do it better than men, that's what the research indicates.

02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:45.920
But I think that what we don't know about lucid dreaming could fill a lot of books.

02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:55.380
So, I think there is some danger in controlling it, because you lose the spontaneous revelation, although not completely because you can't control it completely.

02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:01.840
You might be interested in reading Jung's books on active imagination.

02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:04.840
Because he kind of learned to dream when he was awake.

02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:11.960
And he spent a lot of time in the world of imagination when he was awake, the Red Books, for example.

02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:16.740
Red Book is a document of his experiences with awake dreaming.

02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:23.600
But he was very interactive with the dream, you know, instead of trying to bend it to his whim or his will.

02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:28.060
He was exploring it, in some sense, like you'd explore a video game.

02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:31.580
Which are forms of dreams in and of themselves.

02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:36.720
Yeah, I would say do it with an exploratory purpose in mind.

02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:41.500
You could always ask yourself what you could learn, too, which is a very dangerous question to ask a dream.

02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:44.160
Because sometimes you'll find out what you have to learn.

02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:45.540
That's not so pleasant.

02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:47.280
But it's really worthwhile.

02:19:49.500 --> 02:19:53.220
[APPLAUSE]

02:19:53.300 --> 02:20:03.480
Okay, so I think I'm going to take four more questions, only, because I'm running out of brain, and I don't want to say stupid things, or stupider things than I've already said, so.

02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:06.780
Yeah, thank you for the talk.

02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:18.500
So in the beginning of your lecture, you talked about how society need this kind of dream-like religious base so we don't go between left and right violently, and we can kind of have this base.

02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:27.960
And then you also said you admired Nietzsche for kind of chopping down these ideological and kind of dogmatic needs coming up from the base of Christianity.

02:20:28.060 --> 02:20:39.340
And I was wondering what your thoughts are on how society can this kind of religious base without having these kind of dangerous ideologies that kind of spring up once in a while.

02:20:39.340 --> 02:20:40.880
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:45.400
No, really. That really, that's the serious answer to that question.

02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:53.600
You know, I mean, the reason that i'm an admirer of Nietzsche is because he was the spirit of his times, that's a good way of thinking about it.

02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:55.740
It's not like Nietzsche killed God.

02:20:56.160 --> 02:21:02.200
It's that Nietzsche gathered what was in the air and articulated it, right?

02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:06.380
Incredibly profoundly, and so he put his finger on the spot.

02:21:06.580 --> 02:21:09.660
And in doing so, he announced the problem.

02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:16.480
And once you announce the problem, then maybe you can come up with a solution, because you can't solve a problem unless you know what it is.

02:21:16.500 --> 02:21:24.580
The fact that he made it so stark and so clear is horrifying in some sense, but at least we know where we stand.

02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:38.080
And so, since then, and I would say in many ways particularly with the work of Jung, and everything that's come out of that, which is the deeper study of mythology and its meanings,

02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:43.780
we've been trying to address the issue that Nietzsche brought up and trying to solve the problem.

02:21:43.780 --> 02:21:48.120
The problem is something like the reunification of the spirit of mankind, it's something like that.

02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:57.400
We're slogging through it, man, that's why you're all here, at least in part, so we'll see how far we can get.

02:21:57.480 --> 02:22:03.800
By this rate, we'll get to, like, the twelfth verse in the first [LAUGHTER] but that's the aim, you know?

02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:04.740
Okay?

02:22:05.260 --> 02:22:10.020
[APPLAUSE]

02:22:15.340 --> 02:22:21.480
Yes, they'll be in the video. I can also make them available as slides.

02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:29.200
Yeah, well that's okay. I'll return to this when we get going again.

02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:30.060
So.

02:22:36.220 --> 02:22:44.440
Yeah, different colors represent the distance between the cross-references, yeah.

02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:55.360
Well, I'll talk about that more next time.

02:22:55.360 --> 02:23:00.480
I mean, I think that then best answer to that is I'll talk more about that next time.

02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:00.980
[LAUGHTER]

02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:04.580
I mean I think of them as overlapping metaphorical domains.

02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:11.220
You know, in the descriptions I put of the fatherly aspect, the son aspect, and the spirit aspect, you could swap a lot of those.

02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:12.880
You know, it's kind of arbitrary.

02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:25.800
But I think the Trinitarian idea is trying to get forward the notion that the locus of the Divine is the same thing in its essence, but it exists in a multiplicity.

02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:27.640
It exists as the spirit of tradition.

02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:34.640
It exists as the living individual, in time and space, and then it exists as the spirit.

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:39.080
And its consciousness, that we all share.

02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:50.780
Which, you know, Jung would have thought about that as something like the capacity for the individual to realize the tragedy and redemption of Christ in their individual life.

02:23:51.100 --> 02:24:02.900
And that's something like your capacity to voluntarily accept the tragic conditions of your existence and to move forward to something resembling Paradise, regardless of that.

02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:05.140
You know, as something that's intrinsic to you.

02:24:05.480 --> 02:24:09.020
And I think that's associated with the idea of the Pentecost.

02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:15.880
And the Holy Spirit, all of that, it's, so that's as good as I can do in a short period of time, so.

02:24:16.900 --> 02:24:17.400
Yep.

02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:22.600
[APPLAUSE]

02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:41.000
I think it's because of the gap between what we articulate and what we don't know.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.840
Something has to fill that gap.

02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:48.700
I think the law could replace it if the law is total, but it isn't.

02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:59.880
It's bounded and incorrect, and it has to rest on something inside that's like this mediator between what we articulate and what we don't understand.

02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:03.100
It's something like custom. It's something like expectation.

02:25:03.460 --> 02:25:06.060
It's something like the intrinsic sense of justice.

02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:08.440
You know, that the law itself is aiming at.

02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:11.160
And those aren't fully articulated.

02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:13.320
But without them there'd be no grounding.

02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:17.840
Like, without the body, the law would be a dictionary .

02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:28.880
And if you don't know what a word means, using a dictionary is helpful, but not that helpful, because unless you've had the experience of anger, the dictionary can't tell you what anger means.

02:25:28.980 --> 02:25:30.760
It just refers to other words.

02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:33.520
But the words themselves refer to something else.

02:25:33.780 --> 02:25:36.260
And the law refers to something else.

02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:41.260
And without that, it has to be in tune with that something else, it has to be in accordance with it.

02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:50.680
And so I don't think we can ever delineate the proper body of laws and that's also why ideological utopias,

02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:54.540
see, ideological utopias dispense with the transcendent.

02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:58.080
They say, "This is what we need to do."

02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:05.080
It's like no, you don't know. That's not good. You have to leave space for what you kind of know and what you don't know.

02:26:05.340 --> 02:26:15.520
And in the story of the Tower of Babel, human beings make this massive building that's supposed to reach up to the heavens so that it'll take the place of God.

02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:24.220
Well that's the earliest warning we have of the danger of making things so vague that you confuse them with God.

02:26:24.580 --> 02:26:28.960
And God gets irritated and comes down and makes everybody speak different languages and scatters them.

02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:37.800
It's like, well, that's what happens when you try to make something a totality, is that it starts to fragment inside and disintegrates into catastrophe.

02:26:38.100 --> 02:26:45.540
So we have to maintain this articulated space inside the dream inside the custom, something like that.

02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:46.780
Because otherwise it doesn't work.

02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:50.780
And I think that's the same as having respect for the fact that we have bodies.

02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:54.240
You know, we're not just abstract creatures that follow rules.

02:26:54.540 --> 02:26:55.840
We're not that at all.

02:26:56.060 --> 02:26:58.040
You only follow certain rules.

02:26:58.580 --> 02:27:01.920
We won't follow the other ones, and our societies will crumble.

02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:10.460
And so, we just don't know enough to articulate the entire landscape of behavior with articulated rules, not at all.

02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:12.260
We can't do it, it's beyond us.

02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:20.140
[APPLAUSE]

02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:22.340
Hi, thanks for the talk.

02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:35.860
My question is also about dreams. You spoke about dreams as like a representation of truths and universal truths that can be interpreted into, like, myths and religion.

02:27:36.060 --> 02:27:53.900
And, as you say it, it's very beneficial for the individual, and it sounds like also for society as well because not everyone can as easily remember their dreams, or interpret their dreams.

02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:59.700
And also it's broadcasted to all of society for their benefit.

02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:16.280
So I guess I'm wondering what the evolutionary advantage of dreams are and my question might be, do you think that dreams suggest some sort of evolutionary group selection,

02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:22.400
such that groups that don't have these dreams that are represented into myths and legend, do you think they didn't survive as well?

02:28:22.420 --> 02:28:30.300
Okay, so I'm not going to answer the second part of that question because I'd have to go far too far off at a tangent for me to manage right now.

02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:31.880
But I can answer the first part.

02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:39.120
What happens when you're dreaming, there's a little switch, so to speak, in your brain that shuts off when you're dreaming and it stops you from moving.

02:28:39.340 --> 02:28:46.660
Right? It shuts everything off except your eyes, because if you're moving your eyes back and forth, you're not going to run around and get eaten by a lion.

02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:48.080
It's okay to move your eyes.

02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:50.440
But the rest of you is staying exactly where it is.

02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:52.440
Then you can run these simulations.

02:28:52.980 --> 02:29:00.820
And so what's happening at night, and this is a fairly well-accepted theory of dreaming, we know that dreams update memories and help consolidate memories.

02:29:00.860 --> 02:29:02.160
They also help you forget.

02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:11.500
But what seems to be happening at night is you're running the underlying architecture of your cognitive ability in different simulations.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:17.440
And it's cost free because you're paralyzed. You're not running around out there out in the world, investigating.

02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:24.120
So it's part of the manner in which your brain experiments with the way the world can be represented.

02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:28.000
And so it seems absolutely necessary.

02:29:28.060 --> 02:29:33.180
I mean, if you deprive people of REM sleep, they don't stay sane very long.

02:29:33.380 --> 02:29:40.640
There's something necessary about the dreaming process to maintenance of articulated sanity.

02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:45.760
So you're doing some sort of organization at night when you descend into that chaos.

02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:51.420
Partly what seems to happen is that your categories have boundaries, right?

02:29:51.420 --> 02:29:54.080
But sometimes you don't have the categories correct.

02:29:54.620 --> 02:29:59.940
And so the boundaries have to loosen and other things need to be put into categories with some things shunted away.

02:30:00.300 --> 02:30:04.780
And in the dream, the category structure loosens, which is why dreams are so peculiar.

02:30:05.300 --> 02:30:06.840
But they're experimenting.

02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:12.260
Your mind is experimenting with the underlying categorical structure of imagination.

02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:16.760
And trying to update your mode of being in the world.

02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:20.280
Dreams often concentrate on things that provoke anxiety.

02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:24.740
So if you wake people up when they're dreaming, the most commonly reported emotion is anxiety.

02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:30.320
So the dream is like the first stages of the attempt to contend with the unknown.

02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:33.260
So the dream is half unknown and half known.

02:30:33.260 --> 02:30:38.140
Which is also why it's so peculiar, you know, because you kind of understand it, but you don't really.

02:30:38.340 --> 02:30:41.440
And it partakes of the unknown and the known.

02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:44.620
And it's the bridge between the two, something like that.

02:30:47.460 --> 02:30:52.800
[APPLAUSE]

02:30:54.060 --> 02:30:56.740
Um, okay, so my question is kind of two parts.

02:30:56.820 --> 02:31:00.940
The first one is just like a general question, and then just the application of the question.

02:31:00.940 --> 02:31:07.180
So my first question is, do you think that consciousness and being-hood are inextricably linked?

02:31:07.420 --> 02:31:14.840
And then secondly, so if there something like a super-computer that one could house, theoretically, a perfect brain of a person in it,

02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:19.680
does that thing then become the same person as the person it was before.

02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:23.080
So is there a transcendency to being-hood but not to consciousness?

02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:31.100
Okay, so the first question is, well, I would say that the kind of being that these stories are concerned with is absolutely dependent on consciousness.

02:31:31.100 --> 02:31:37.140
Now whether or not that means that being as such is dependent on consciousness actually depends on how you define being.

02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:43.980
So it's always tricky when you ask is a, here's an example of meaning.

02:31:43.980 --> 02:31:47.160
Those are tricky questions because it depends on how you define the two.

02:31:47.320 --> 02:31:55.420
But for our purposes the being that we're discussing, that's represented in these stories, is intrinsically associated with conscious experience.

02:31:55.820 --> 02:32:05.780
And consciousness is given this constitutive role, the experience that we're talking about would not exist if consciousness did not exist.

02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:12.280
So you can think about it as sort of a game, in a way, and then you have to decide for yourself whether that's a game that can be generalized.

02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:15.720
And I won't answer the second part, okay? If you don't mind.

02:32:15.820 --> 02:32:16.320
[LAUGHTER]

02:32:16.320 --> 02:32:16.820
All right.

02:32:16.820 --> 02:32:21.020
[APPLAUSE]

02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:29.720
So, two part question. First one's very quick. If we want to read the Biblical stories that kind of you're referring to as a particular version, edition, source, publisher...

02:32:29.720 --> 02:32:35.920
Oh I'll bring the thing I like next week. I think the Reader's Digest published it of all things.

02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:43.680
It lays out the narratives in a different format. It's easier, I find it much easier to read.

02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:46.360
So I'll bring it next time and show it to you.

02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:55.680
My other question is, one of the main reasons why I'm interested in so much of your work and I think many are as well, is you leave literalism in the door and you open up another door to a much more deeper meaning.

02:32:55.720 --> 02:33:01.960
In your interview with Transliminal Media, you mentioned Liz [UNINTELLIGIBLE] book, the serpent, uh, the tree, the serpent...

02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:02.840
Yeah, yeah.

02:33:02.900 --> 02:33:09.980
And you note that we as a species are very good at recognizing camouflage patterns of snakes, particularly in the lower field of vision.

02:33:09.980 --> 02:33:15.000
And you further note that visual acuity is correlated with that and that it co-evolved.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:20.140
And you summarized thusly by saying the following, I'm paraphrasing you, you said "What gives you vision? Snakes do."

02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:23.820
"That's what it says in Genesis. What else gives you vision? Fruit. That's also right."

02:33:23.820 --> 02:33:28.540
"That's why we have color vision. What makes you self-conscious if you're a man? Woman. That's Eve."

02:33:28.540 --> 02:33:34.320
And so, I understand at the elementary level some of the concepts that you have about representations, dreams, abstractions, etc.

02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:38.800
But it kind of raises the question for me, I'm not accusing you of any creationism or literalism.

02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:39.380
Yep.

02:33:39.380 --> 02:33:45.940
You know, what's your point? Why did you make that connection? What's the meaning of the story of Genesis vis-a-vis Liz [UNINTELLIGIBLE] book?

02:33:46.100 --> 02:33:53.720
No problem. As soon as I get past this first, this one, we're going to hit that hard. [LAUGHTER]

02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:55.780
So [APPLAUSE]

02:33:57.660 --> 02:33:58.920
Well, partly

02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:08.800
Yes, I'm suggesting that it foreshadowed it.

02:34:09.100 --> 02:34:10.980
And I think they're the same thing.

02:34:10.980 --> 02:34:16.880
I mean Liz [UNINTELLIGIBLE] in her books plays with that idea, metaphorically, but she never really takes it seriously, which is no problem.

02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:20.620
I mean there's only so much you can take seriously, and she did a fine job of what she did.

02:34:20.940 --> 02:34:24.600
But I'll talk about that a lot. That's a very complicated issue.

02:34:24.900 --> 02:34:35.300
I mean, I would say, to begin with, that the systems that you use to deal with radical uncertainty are the same systems that your primate ancestors evolved to deal with snakes.

02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:36.960
That's a good start.

02:34:37.500 --> 02:34:41.140
So, okay? Okay. One more, and then we're done. [APPLAUSE]

02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:51.720
I'm an aerospace science engineer and an expert computer programmer, and I have three rapid-fire questions so I'm going to get to them quick.

02:34:51.980 --> 02:35:02.260
Based on your opinion of where the universities now stand in terms of humanities and social sciences, is mathematics more powerful than articulated speech?

02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:08.440
I'm not exactly sure how the first...

02:35:13.220 --> 02:35:17.680
Oh, well, it depends on what you mean by power, I guess.

02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:23.940
I mean, it's obvious that studying mathematics and computer science makes you insanely powerful. The question is: to what end?

02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:28.960
And I don't think that you can extract an answer to that from the study of mathematics.

02:35:28.980 --> 02:35:32.320
The humanities are there to ground people in proper citizen-hood.

02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:34.580
That's a way of thinking about it.

02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:38.780
Yes it makes you powerful, but then the question is, who has the power?

02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:43.680
Because it might not be you. It might be the mathematics, so to speak, you know?

02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:46.100
Because you never know what you're an agent of.

02:35:46.200 --> 02:35:47.000
Precisely.

02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:48.040
And so...

02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:53.080
Yeah, well, look, I've got nothing against computer programmers, more power to you guys.

02:35:53.140 --> 02:35:55.620
And mathematicians as well, but I...

02:35:57.280 --> 02:36:01.640
Yes, it has to be a tool of something.

02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:07.140
And what the humanities were for was to tell people what the tools should be used for.

02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:10.740
And so the tools themselves are crazily powerful.

02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:16.480
But that's not necessarily an un-trammeled good, so.

02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:20.520
I have to stop, because... okay, quick.

02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:21.180
[LAUGHTER]

02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:36.220
Okay, you were in this one room in New York where you had seen some original Renaissance artwork masterpieces and these are generally accepted as amazing artifacts.

02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:53.040
Does an original work of art, as opposed to a high-fidelity reproduction, contain the spirit of the artist who created it, and does this account for the disparity in how much you have to pay for them?

02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:54.120
It does in part.

02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:55.920
I know a good portrait artist, okay?

02:36:56.440 --> 02:37:01.780
And one of the things he pointed out about a great portrait is that it actually contains time.

02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:04.800
Because a photograph is one instant.

02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:10.860
But portrait is you layered on you, layered on you. So it's got a thickness.

02:37:11.180 --> 02:37:18.180
You know? And I think you can see that thickness in the original, but it's also a direct manifestation of that creative act of perception.

02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:24.500
I don't think you get that, you just can't get the fidelity of the original with the reproduction.

02:37:24.500 --> 02:37:28.520
But there's more to it than that too, because the painting doesn't end with the frame.

02:37:28.700 --> 02:37:38.520
You know, like we tend to think of the painting itself as the object, but most objects are densely innervated with historical context.

02:37:38.520 --> 02:37:43.960
And you can say, well, the historical context isn't the object, but it depends on what you mean by the object.

02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:49.160
And often people, when they buy a painting, are buying the historical context.

02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:51.280
You just don't get that with a reproduction.

02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:53.140
It's a kind of magic.

02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:56.860
It's like, you want to have Elvis Presley's guitar or another guitar just like it?

02:37:57.420 --> 02:37:59.120
Well, you want to have Elvis's guitar.

02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:02.520
Why? You can't tell it's Elvis's guitar by looking at it.

02:38:05.700 --> 02:38:08.440
[LAUGHTER]

02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:15.380
Well, it is at the level of detail, but not at the level of context.

02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:16.740
That's how it looks to me.

02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:26.780
Okay, we gotta go. [APPLAUSE] Thank you.
