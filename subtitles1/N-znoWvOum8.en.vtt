00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
obviously at some point we're going to
 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.070 align:start position:0%
obviously at some point we're going to
get<00:07:35.680><c> into</c><00:07:36.400><c> the</c><00:07:36.560><c> issue</c><00:07:36.800><c> of</c><00:07:36.879><c> the</c><00:07:37.000><c> carnivore</c><00:07:37.560><c> diet</c>
