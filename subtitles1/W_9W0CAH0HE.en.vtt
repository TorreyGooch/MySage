00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
let's how about that as a thought
 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.950 align:start position:0%
let's how about that as a thought
process<00:06:05.240><c> and</c><00:06:05.440><c> yes</c><00:06:05.800><c> so</c><00:06:06.080><c> that</c><00:06:06.360><c> that</c><00:06:06.520><c> evolved</c>

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
process and yes so that that evolved
 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.550 align:start position:0%
process and yes so that that evolved
over<00:06:07.240><c> time</c><00:06:08.120><c> um</c><00:06:08.520><c> but</c><00:06:08.680><c> I</c><00:06:08.759><c> think</c><00:06:08.919><c> we</c><00:06:09.039><c> also</c><00:06:09.280><c> have</c><00:06:09.400><c> to</c>

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
over time um but I think we also have to
 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.309 align:start position:0%
over time um but I think we also have to
remember<00:06:09.960><c> that</c><00:06:10.120><c> the</c><00:06:10.280><c> military</c><00:06:10.919><c> the</c><00:06:11.039><c> armed</c>

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
remember that the military the armed
 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.550 align:start position:0%
remember that the military the armed

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
