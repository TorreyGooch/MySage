00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
I've been asked to say a few&nbsp;
words to the truckers in Ottawa.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.080
I've given that some careful consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.880
You protesters habe accomplished an awful lot&nbsp;
already. The conservative leadership has crumbled.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.400
Erin O'Toole has been replaced by someone who&nbsp;
is giving a fair bit of voice to your concerns.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.840
All the people you represent have&nbsp;
a voice in the house of commons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.520
You have four provinces that&nbsp;
have moved quite precipitously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.680
in the direction that the protest was hoping&nbsp;
for. They are starting to lift mask mandates on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.240
something approximating as reasonable a timeline&nbsp;
as might be expected under the circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.640
You're now faced with a difficult choice:&nbsp;
what are your criteria for satisfaction.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.600
You need to determine that, so that you&nbsp;
can negotiate with the necessary people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.280
You're also faced with another danger&nbsp;
at the moment, now that which is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.840
the political process bent in the direction&nbsp;
that you've insisted upon -- rightly, in my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.040
estimation. This, more and more of you who are&nbsp;
most reasonable are going to pack up and leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.760
or decide that this is done sometime over&nbsp;
the next week or so (or couple of weeks:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.720
that's obviously up to you) --, but there'll&nbsp;
be a remnant that's much more committed in some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.880
sense to more extreme goals.That's going&nbsp;
to be something very difficult to manage.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.600
I'd like to commend all of you for your&nbsp;
diligence and work -- on accomplishing what you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.480
have accomplished under trying conditions -- and&nbsp;
also for keeping your heads in a way that's been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.160
a model for the entire world. You've been able&nbsp;
to remain peaceful. You haven't taken the bait.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.480
You haven't responded with violence to quite&nbsp;
remarkable denigration and provocation. That's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.760
a sign of tremendous discipline and care.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.240
It's going to get more difficult to maintain as&nbsp;
this goes along. So I hope that you're all able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.920
allow a sufficient victory to be sufficient,&nbsp;
to move forward without greed -- to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.280
be grateful for the effect that you've&nbsp;
already had, and the support you've received,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.000
to move forward to a normative peace and the&nbsp;
re-establishment of our country's economy and our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:31.440
psychological and social wellbeing. That's pretty&nbsp;
much all I have to say at this point. Thank you.
