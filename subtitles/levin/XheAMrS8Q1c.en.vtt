Chris Anderson: Mike, welcome.

00:00:14.334 --> 00:00:16.975
It's good to see you.
I'm excited for this conversation.

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.769
Michael Levin: Thank you so much.
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:19.793 --> 00:00:22.852
CA: So, most of us have
this mental model in biology

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:27.136
that DNA is a property
of every living thing,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.571
that it is kind of the software
that builds the hardware of our body.

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:34.682
That's how a lot of us think about this.

00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:37.949
That model leaves too many deep mysteries.

00:00:37.973 --> 00:00:40.920
Can you share with us
some of those mysteries

00:00:40.944 --> 00:00:43.538
and also what tadpoles have to do with it?

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:45.658
ML: Sure. Yeah.

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:48.387
I'd like to give you another
perspective on this problem.

00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:52.899
One of the things that DNA does
is specify the hardware of each cell.

00:00:52.923 --> 00:00:57.244
So the DNA tells every cell
what proteins it's supposed to have.

00:00:57.268 --> 00:01:00.092
And so when you have
tadpoles, for example,

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:02.430
you see the kind of thing

00:01:02.454 --> 00:01:07.145
that most people think is sort of
a progressive unrolling of the genome.

00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:09.142
Specific genes turn on and off,

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.415
and a tadpole, as it becomes a frog,

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.926
has to rearrange its face.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.918
So the eyes, the nostrils, the jaws --
everything has to move.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:18.390
And one way to think about it
used to be that, well,

00:01:18.414 --> 00:01:20.760
you have a sort of hardwired
set of movements

00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:24.013
where all of these things move around
and then you get your frog.

00:01:24.037 --> 00:01:27.289
But actually, a few years ago,
we found a pretty amazing phenomenon,

00:01:27.313 --> 00:01:30.275
which is that if you make
so-called "Picasso frogs" --

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.615
these are tadpoles where the jaws
might be off to the side,

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:35.758
the eyes are up here,
the nostrils are moved,

00:01:35.782 --> 00:01:37.256
so everything is shifted --

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.801
these tadpoles make
largely normal frog faces.

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:41.976
Now, this is amazing,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.898
because all of the organs
start off in abnormal positions,

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:48.651
and yet they still end up making
a pretty good frog face.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.961
And so what it turns out
is that this system,

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:52.797
like many living systems,

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.953
is not a hardwired set of movements,

00:01:54.977 --> 00:01:58.715
but actually works to reduce the error
between what's going on now

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:02.241
and what it knows is a correct
frog face configuration.

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:03.715
This kind of decision-making

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:07.880
that involves flexible responses
to new circumstances,

00:02:07.904 --> 00:02:10.320
in other contexts,
we would call this intelligence.

00:02:10.344 --> 00:02:14.580
And so what we need to understand now
is not only the mechanisms

00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:16.725
by which these cells
execute their movements

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.237
and gene expression and so on,

00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:21.047
but we really have to understand
the information flow:

00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:23.177
How do these cells
cooperate with each other

00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:26.758
to build something large
and to stop building

00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:29.806
when that specific structure is created?

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.536
And these kinds of computations,
not just the mechanisms,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.529
but the computations
of anatomical control,

00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:37.022
are the future of biology.

00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:39.264
CA: And so I guess the traditional model

00:02:39.288 --> 00:02:43.953
is that somehow cells are sending
biochemical signals to each other

00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:48.271
that allow that development
to happen the smart way.

00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:50.726
But you think there is
something else at work.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.912
What is that?

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:55.702
ML: Well, cells certainly do communicate
biochemically and via physical forces,

00:02:55.726 --> 00:02:58.809
but there's something else going on
that's extremely interesting,

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:02.187
and it's basically called bioelectricity,

00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:04.091
non-neural bioelectricity.

00:03:04.115 --> 00:03:05.710
So it turns out that all cells --

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:07.909
not just nerves,
but all cells in your body --

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:10.422
communicate with each other
using electrical signals.

00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:12.867
And what you're seeing here
is a time-lapse video.

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:14.095
For the first time,

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.531
we are now able to eavesdrop
on all of the electrical conversations

00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:19.636
that the cells are having with each other.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.839
So think about this.

00:03:20.863 --> 00:03:22.022
We're now watching --

00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:23.477
This is an early frog embryo.

00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:26.016
This is about eight hours
to 10 hours of development.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.039
And the colors are showing you
actual electrical states

00:03:30.063 --> 00:03:33.093
that allow you to see
all of the electrical software

00:03:33.117 --> 00:03:36.690
that's running on the genome-defined
cellular hardware.

00:03:36.714 --> 00:03:40.690
And so these cells are basically
communicating with each other

00:03:40.714 --> 00:03:43.079
who is going to be head,
who is going to be tail,

00:03:43.103 --> 00:03:46.340
who is going to be left and right
and make eyes and brain and so on.

00:03:46.364 --> 00:03:47.867
And so it is this software

00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:51.701
that allows these living systems
to achieve specific goals,

00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:53.272
goals such as building an embryo

00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:56.605
or regenerating a limb
for animals that do this,

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.174
and the ability to see
these electrical conversations

00:04:02.198 --> 00:04:05.058
gives us some really
remarkable opportunities

00:04:05.082 --> 00:04:08.269
to target or to rewrite
the goals towards which

00:04:08.293 --> 00:04:10.283
these living systems are operating.

00:04:10.307 --> 00:04:12.013
CA: OK, so this is pretty radical.

00:04:12.037 --> 00:04:14.048
Let me see if I understand this.

00:04:14.072 --> 00:04:18.315
What you're saying is that
when an organism starts to develop,

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.785
as soon as a cell divides,

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:23.096
electrical signals are shared
between them.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.677
But as you get to, what,
a hundred, a few hundred cells,

00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:33.980
that somehow these signals end up forming
essentially like a computer program,

00:04:34.004 --> 00:04:39.380
a program that somehow includes
all the information needed

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.071
to tell that organism

00:04:41.095 --> 00:04:42.996
what its destiny is?

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.017
Is that the right way to think about it?

00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:46.274
ML: Yes, quite.

00:04:46.298 --> 00:04:48.422
Basically, what happens
is that these cells,

00:04:48.446 --> 00:04:52.397
by forming electrical networks
much like networks in the brain,

00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:54.621
they form electrical networks,

00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:58.726
and these networks process information
including pattern memories.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.587
They include representation
of large-scale anatomical structures

00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:05.224
where various organs will go,

00:05:05.248 --> 00:05:08.920
what the different axes of the animal --
front and back, head and tail --

00:05:08.944 --> 00:05:10.102
are going to be,

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:12.740
and these are literally
held in the electrical circuits

00:05:12.764 --> 00:05:14.425
across large tissues

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.420
in the same way that brains
hold other kinds of memories and learning.

00:05:20.444 --> 00:05:22.669
CA: So is this the right way
to think about it?

00:05:22.693 --> 00:05:24.796
Because this seems to be such a big shift.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.669
I mean, when I first got a computer,

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:32.312
I was in awe of the people
who could do so-called "machine code,"

00:05:32.336 --> 00:05:36.363
like the direct programming
of individual bits in the computer.

00:05:36.387 --> 00:05:38.201
That was impossible for most mortals.

00:05:38.225 --> 00:05:40.396
To have a chance
of controlling that computer,

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.845
you'd have to program in a language,

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:49.848
which was a vastly simpler way
of making big-picture things happen.

00:05:49.872 --> 00:05:51.312
And if I understand you right,

00:05:51.336 --> 00:05:54.735
what you're saying is that most of biology
today has sort of taken place

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.401
trying to do the equivalent
of machine code programming,

00:05:57.425 --> 00:06:00.614
of understanding the biochemical signals
between individual cells,

00:06:00.638 --> 00:06:03.956
when, wait a sec, holy crap,
there's this language going on,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.514
this electrical language,
which, if you could understand that,

00:06:08.538 --> 00:06:11.566
that would give us a completely
different set of insights

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.899
into how organisms are developing.

00:06:13.923 --> 00:06:15.790
Is that metaphor basically right?

00:06:15.814 --> 00:06:17.383
ML: Yeah, this is exactly right.

00:06:17.407 --> 00:06:20.418
So if you think about the way
programming was done in the '40s,

00:06:20.442 --> 00:06:23.091
in order to get your computer
to do something different,

00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:25.567
you would physically
have to shift the wires around.

00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:28.089
So you'd have to go in there
and rewire the hardware.

00:06:28.113 --> 00:06:30.450
You'd have to interact
with the hardware directly,

00:06:30.474 --> 00:06:33.194
and all of your strategies
for manipulating that machine

00:06:33.218 --> 00:06:35.062
would be at the level of the hardware.

00:06:35.086 --> 00:06:38.181
And the reason we have
this now amazing technology revolution,

00:06:38.205 --> 00:06:40.070
information sciences and so on,

00:06:40.094 --> 00:06:43.920
is because computer science moved
from a focus on the hardware

00:06:43.944 --> 00:06:46.787
on to understanding that if
your hardware is good enough --

00:06:46.811 --> 00:06:50.600
and I'm going to tell you that biological
hardware is absolutely good enough --

00:06:50.624 --> 00:06:56.048
then you can interact with your system
not by tweaking or rewiring the hardware,

00:06:56.072 --> 00:06:59.842
but actually, you can take a step back
and give it stimuli or inputs

00:06:59.866 --> 00:07:02.874
the way that you would give
to a reprogrammable computer

00:07:02.898 --> 00:07:07.683
and cause the cellular network
to do something completely different

00:07:07.707 --> 00:07:09.364
than it would otherwise have done.

00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:12.936
So the ability to see
these bioelectrical signals

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.823
is giving us an entry point
directly into the software

00:07:15.847 --> 00:07:17.868
that guides large-scale anatomy,

00:07:17.892 --> 00:07:21.072
which is a very different
approach to medicine

00:07:21.096 --> 00:07:24.476
than to rewiring specific pathways
inside of every cell.

00:07:25.087 --> 00:07:27.975
CA: And so in many ways,
this is the amazingness of your work

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:31.310
is that you're starting to crack the code
of these electrical signals,

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:33.680
and you've got an amazing
demonstration of this

00:07:33.704 --> 00:07:35.013
in these flatworms.

00:07:35.037 --> 00:07:37.593
Tell us what's going on here.

00:07:37.617 --> 00:07:40.245
ML: So this is a creature
known as a planarian.

00:07:40.269 --> 00:07:41.759
They're flatworms.

00:07:41.783 --> 00:07:43.821
They're actually quite a complex creature.

00:07:43.845 --> 00:07:46.667
They have a true brain,
lots of different organs and so on.

00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:48.692
And the amazing thing about these planaria

00:07:48.716 --> 00:07:50.823
is that they are highly,
highly regenerative.

00:07:50.847 --> 00:07:54.956
So if you cut it into pieces --
in fact, over 200 pieces --

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.520
every piece will rebuild
exactly what's needed

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:00.004
to make a perfect little worm.

00:08:00.028 --> 00:08:01.199
So think about that.

00:08:01.223 --> 00:08:03.240
This is a system where every single piece

00:08:03.264 --> 00:08:06.255
knows exactly what
a correct planarian looks like

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:09.783
and builds the right organs
in the right places and then stops.

00:08:09.807 --> 00:08:12.739
And that's one of the most
amazing things about regeneration.

00:08:12.763 --> 00:08:15.875
So what we discovered is that
if you cut it into three pieces

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:19.417
and amputate the head and the tail
and you just take this middle fragment,

00:08:19.441 --> 00:08:20.803
which is what you see here,

00:08:20.827 --> 00:08:24.542
amazingly, there is an electrical
gradient, head to tail, that's generated

00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:27.568
that tells the piece
where the heads and the tails go

00:08:27.592 --> 00:08:30.504
and in fact, how many heads or tails
you're supposed to have.

00:08:30.528 --> 00:08:34.855
So what we learned to do
is to manipulate this electrical gradient,

00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:37.745
and the important thing
is that we don't apply electricity.

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:41.960
What we do instead was we turned
on and off the little transistors --

00:08:41.984 --> 00:08:44.029
they're actual ion channel proteins --

00:08:44.053 --> 00:08:47.433
that every cell natively uses
to set up this electrical state.

00:08:47.457 --> 00:08:49.802
So now we have ways
to turn them on and off,

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:52.222
and when you do this,
one of the things you can do

00:08:52.246 --> 00:08:56.366
is you can shift that circuit
to a state that says no, build two heads,

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.983
or in fact, build no heads.

00:08:58.007 --> 00:09:02.070
And what you're seeing here are real worms
that have either two or no heads

00:09:02.094 --> 00:09:03.261
that result from this,

00:09:03.285 --> 00:09:06.274
because that electrical map
is what the cells are using

00:09:06.298 --> 00:09:08.018
to decide what to do.

00:09:08.042 --> 00:09:11.360
And so what you're seeing here
are live two-headed worms.

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:15.475
And, having generated these,
we did a completely crazy experiment.

00:09:15.499 --> 00:09:19.414
You take one of these two-headed worms,
and you chop off both heads,

00:09:19.438 --> 00:09:21.642
and you leave just
the normal middle fragment.

00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:24.951
Now keep in mind, these animals
have not been genomically edited.

00:09:24.975 --> 00:09:27.686
There's absolutely nothing different
about their genomes.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.026
Their genome sequence
is completely wild type.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.585
So you amputate the heads,
you've got a nice normal fragment,

00:09:34.609 --> 00:09:37.417
and then you ask: In plain water,
what is it going to do?

00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:39.727
And, of course, the standard
paradigm would say,

00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:42.441
well, if you've gotten rid
of this ectopic extra tissue,

00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:46.325
the genome is not edited so it should
make a perfectly normal worm.

00:09:46.349 --> 00:09:49.228
And the amazing thing is
that it is not what happens.

00:09:49.252 --> 00:09:55.164
These worms, when cut again and again,
in the future, in plain water,

00:09:55.188 --> 00:09:57.787
they continue to regenerate as two-headed.

00:09:57.811 --> 00:09:58.974
Think about this.

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:04.207
The pattern memory to which these animals
will regenerate after damage

00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:06.183
has been permanently rewritten.

00:10:06.207 --> 00:10:09.908
And in fact, we can now write it back
and send them back to being one-headed

00:10:09.932 --> 00:10:11.744
without any genomic editing.

00:10:11.768 --> 00:10:14.872
So this right here is telling you
that the information structure

00:10:14.896 --> 00:10:17.813
that tells these worms how many heads
they're supposed to have

00:10:17.837 --> 00:10:19.368
is not directly in the genome.

00:10:19.392 --> 00:10:21.523
It is in this additional
bioelectric layer.

00:10:21.547 --> 00:10:23.439
Probably many other things are as well.

00:10:23.463 --> 00:10:25.752
And we now have the ability to rewrite it.

00:10:25.776 --> 00:10:29.455
And that, of course,
is the key definition of memory.

00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:33.147
It has to be stable, long-term stable,
and it has to be rewritable.

00:10:33.171 --> 00:10:36.880
And we are now beginning to crack
this morphogenetic code

00:10:36.904 --> 00:10:41.785
to ask how is it that these tissues
store a map of what to do

00:10:41.809 --> 00:10:45.526
and how we can go in
and rewrite that map to new outcomes.

00:10:46.674 --> 00:10:50.494
CA: I mean, that seems
incredibly compelling evidence

00:10:50.518 --> 00:10:57.509
that DNA is just not
controlling the actual final shape

00:10:57.533 --> 00:10:59.161
of these organisms,

00:10:59.185 --> 00:11:02.410
that there's this
whole other thing going on,

00:11:02.434 --> 00:11:04.315
and, boy, if you could crack that code,

00:11:04.339 --> 00:11:06.407
what else could that lead to.

00:11:06.431 --> 00:11:08.450
By the way, just looking at these ones.

00:11:08.474 --> 00:11:11.427
What is life like
for a two-headed flatworm?

00:11:11.451 --> 00:11:13.695
I mean, it seems like
it's kind of a trade-off.

00:11:13.719 --> 00:11:17.664
The good news is you have this amazing
three-dimensional view of the world,

00:11:17.688 --> 00:11:22.025
but the bad news is you have
to poop through both of your mouths?

00:11:22.901 --> 00:11:26.916
ML: So, the worms have
these little tubes called pharynxes,

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.397
and the tubes are sort of
in the middle of the body,

00:11:29.421 --> 00:11:30.891
and they excrete through that.

00:11:30.915 --> 00:11:32.593
These animals are perfectly viable.

00:11:32.617 --> 00:11:35.548
They're completely happy, I think.

00:11:35.572 --> 00:11:36.755
The problem, however,

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:39.250
is that the two heads
don't cooperate all that well,

00:11:39.274 --> 00:11:41.215
and so they don't really eat very well.

00:11:41.239 --> 00:11:43.114
But if you manage to feed them by hand,

00:11:43.138 --> 00:11:44.289
they will go on forever,

00:11:44.313 --> 00:11:47.377
and in fact, you should know
these worms are basically immortal.

00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:50.724
So these worms, because
they are so highly regenerative,

00:11:50.748 --> 00:11:52.189
they have no age limit,

00:11:52.213 --> 00:11:55.562
and they're telling us that
if we crack this secret of regeneration,

00:11:55.586 --> 00:11:58.666
which is not only growing new cells
but knowing when to stop --

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.585
you see, this is absolutely crucial --

00:12:00.609 --> 00:12:04.783
if you can continue to exert
this really profound control

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:08.283
over the three-dimensional structures
that the cells are working towards,

00:12:08.307 --> 00:12:11.193
you could defeat aging
as well as traumatic injury

00:12:11.217 --> 00:12:12.380
and things like this.

00:12:12.404 --> 00:12:15.805
So one thing to keep in mind
is that this ability to rewrite

00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:18.250
the large-scale anatomical
structure of the body

00:12:18.274 --> 00:12:20.416
is not just a weird planarian trick.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.718
It's not just something
that works in flatworms.

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:26.688
What you're seeing here is a tadpole
with an eye and a gut,

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:31.209
and what we've done is turned on
a very specific ion channel.

00:12:31.233 --> 00:12:34.618
So we basically just manipulated
these little electrical transistors

00:12:34.642 --> 00:12:36.148
that are inside of cells,

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:39.925
and we've imposed a state
on some of these gut cells

00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:42.485
that's normally associated
with building an eye.

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:45.371
And as a result, what the cells do
is they build an eye.

00:12:45.395 --> 00:12:46.717
These eyes are complete.

00:12:46.741 --> 00:12:50.007
They have optic nerve, lens, retina,

00:12:50.031 --> 00:12:52.462
all the same stuff that an eye
is supposed to have.

00:12:52.486 --> 00:12:54.566
They can see, by the way,
out of these eyes.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.953
And what you're seeing here

00:12:55.977 --> 00:12:58.504
is that by triggering
eye-building subroutines

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:01.228
in the physiological software of the body,

00:13:01.252 --> 00:13:04.777
you can very easily tell it
to build a complex organ.

00:13:04.801 --> 00:13:06.951
And this is important for our biomedicine,

00:13:06.975 --> 00:13:10.202
because we don't know how to micromanage
the construction of an eye.

00:13:10.226 --> 00:13:12.272
I think it's going to be
a really long time

00:13:12.296 --> 00:13:17.243
before we can really bottom-up build
things like eyes or hands and so on.

00:13:17.267 --> 00:13:20.394
But we don't need to, because the body
already knows how to do it,

00:13:20.418 --> 00:13:23.193
and there are these subroutines
that can be triggered

00:13:23.217 --> 00:13:26.139
by specific electrical patterns
that we can find.

00:13:26.163 --> 00:13:29.444
And this is what we call
"cracking the bioelectric code."

00:13:29.468 --> 00:13:31.469
We can make eyes. We can make extra limbs.

00:13:31.493 --> 00:13:33.562
Here's one of our five-legged tadpoles.

00:13:33.586 --> 00:13:35.375
We can make extra hearts.

00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:39.120
We're starting to crack the code
to understand where are the subroutines

00:13:39.144 --> 00:13:40.323
in this software

00:13:40.347 --> 00:13:43.337
that we can trigger
and build these complex organs

00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:46.435
long before we actually know
how to micromanage the process

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:47.877
at the cellular level.

00:13:47.901 --> 00:13:52.743
CA: So as you've started to get
to learn this electrical layer

00:13:52.767 --> 00:13:53.948
and what it can do,

00:13:53.972 --> 00:13:56.499
you've been able to create --

00:13:56.523 --> 00:14:00.062
is it fair to say it's almost
like a new, a novel life-form,

00:14:00.086 --> 00:14:01.256
called a xenobot?

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.041
Talk to me about xenobots.

00:14:03.065 --> 00:14:04.216
ML: Right.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.530
So if you think about this,
this leads to a really strange prediction.

00:14:08.554 --> 00:14:12.510
If the cells are really willing to build
towards a specific map,

00:14:12.534 --> 00:14:16.224
we could take genetically unaltered cells,

00:14:16.248 --> 00:14:19.716
and what you're seeing here
is cells taken out of a frog body.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.618
They've coalesced in a way that asks them
to re-envision their multicellularity.

00:14:24.642 --> 00:14:25.807
And what you see here

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:28.826
is that when liberated from the rest
of the body of the animal,

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.774
they make these tiny little novel bodies
that are, in terms of behavior,

00:14:32.798 --> 00:14:35.225
you can see they can move,
they can run a maze.

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:38.753
They are completely different
from frogs or tadpoles.

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:44.909
Frog cells, when asked to re-envision
what kind of body they want to make,

00:14:44.933 --> 00:14:46.926
do something incredibly interesting.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:51.974
They use the hardware
that their genetics gives them,

00:14:51.998 --> 00:14:54.402
for example, these
little hairs, these little cilia

00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:58.031
that are normally used to redistribute
mucus on the outside of a frog,

00:14:58.055 --> 00:14:59.717
those are genetically specified.

00:14:59.741 --> 00:15:02.095
But what these creatures did,

00:15:02.119 --> 00:15:06.768
because the cells are able
to form novel kinds of bodies,

00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:09.463
they have figured out
how to use these little cilia

00:15:09.487 --> 00:15:13.593
to instead row against the water,
and now have locomotion.

00:15:13.617 --> 00:15:18.375
So not only can they move around,
but they can, and here what you're seeing,

00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:21.218
is that these cells
are coalescing together.

00:15:21.242 --> 00:15:24.829
Now they're starting to have conversations
about what they are going to do.

00:15:24.853 --> 00:15:28.630
You can see here the flashes
are these exchanges of information.

00:15:28.654 --> 00:15:30.921
Keep in mind, this is just skin.

00:15:30.945 --> 00:15:34.905
There is no nervous system.
There is no brain. This is just skin.

00:15:34.929 --> 00:15:37.405
This is skin that has learned
to make a new body

00:15:37.429 --> 00:15:40.166
and to explore its environment
and move around.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.721
And they have spontaneous behaviors.

00:15:42.745 --> 00:15:45.224
You can see here where
it's swimming down this maze.

00:15:45.248 --> 00:15:48.693
At this point, it decides to turn around
and go back where it came from.

00:15:48.717 --> 00:15:52.246
So it has its own behavior,
and this is a remarkable model system

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.470
for several reasons.

00:15:53.494 --> 00:15:57.242
First of all, it shows us
the amazing plasticity of cells

00:15:57.266 --> 00:15:58.859
that are genetically wild type.

00:15:58.883 --> 00:16:00.585
There is no genetic editing here.

00:16:00.609 --> 00:16:05.738
These are cells that are really prone
to making some sort of functional body.

00:16:05.762 --> 00:16:06.913
The second thing,

00:16:06.937 --> 00:16:10.250
and this was done in collaboration
with Josh Bongard's lab at UVM,

00:16:10.274 --> 00:16:16.560
they modeled the structure of these things
and evolved it in a virtual world.

00:16:16.584 --> 00:16:19.863
So this is literally -- on a computer,
they modeled it on a computer.

00:16:19.887 --> 00:16:23.939
So this is literally the only organism
that I know of on the face of this planet

00:16:23.963 --> 00:16:27.122
whose evolution took place
not in the biosphere of the earth

00:16:27.146 --> 00:16:29.056
but inside a computer.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.768
So the individual cells
have an evolutionary history,

00:16:31.792 --> 00:16:34.236
but this organism
has never existed before.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.669
It was evolved in this virtual world,

00:16:36.693 --> 00:16:39.329
and then we went ahead
and made it in the lab,

00:16:39.353 --> 00:16:41.857
and you can see this amazing plasticity.

00:16:41.881 --> 00:16:45.092
This is not only
for making useful machines.

00:16:45.116 --> 00:16:49.105
You can imagine now programming these
to go out into the environment

00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:50.785
and collect toxins and cleanup,

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:53.302
or you could imagine ones
made out of human cells

00:16:53.326 --> 00:16:56.321
that would go through your body
and collect cancer cells

00:16:56.345 --> 00:16:58.770
or reshape arthritic joints,

00:16:58.794 --> 00:17:01.163
deliver pro-regenerative compounds,

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:02.338
all kinds of things.

00:17:02.362 --> 00:17:05.837
But not only these useful applications --
this is an amazing sandbox

00:17:05.861 --> 00:17:10.463
for learning to communicate
morphogenetic signals to cell collectives.

00:17:10.487 --> 00:17:15.393
So once we crack this, once we understand
how these cells decide what to do,

00:17:15.417 --> 00:17:18.766
and then we're going to, of course,
learn to rewrite that information,

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:23.621
the next steps are great improvements
in regenerative medicine,

00:17:23.645 --> 00:17:27.382
because we will then be able
to tell cells to build healthy organs.

00:17:27.406 --> 00:17:30.667
And so this is now
a really critical opportunity

00:17:30.691 --> 00:17:32.788
to learn to communicate with cell groups,

00:17:32.812 --> 00:17:35.351
not to micromanage them,
not to force the hardware,

00:17:35.375 --> 00:17:39.525
to communicate and rewrite the goals
that these cells are trying to accomplish.

00:17:40.026 --> 00:17:42.008
CA: Well, it's mind-boggling stuff.

00:17:42.032 --> 00:17:45.190
Finally, Mike, give us
just one other story

00:17:45.214 --> 00:17:48.325
about medicine that might be to come

00:17:48.349 --> 00:17:51.445
as you develop this understanding

00:17:51.469 --> 00:17:54.233
of how this bioelectric layer works.

00:17:54.818 --> 00:17:58.212
ML: Yeah, this is incredibly exciting
because, if you think about it,

00:17:58.236 --> 00:18:00.125
most of the problems of biomedicine --

00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:06.215
birth defects, degenerative disease,
aging, traumatic injury, even cancer --

00:18:06.239 --> 00:18:07.953
all boil down to one thing:

00:18:07.977 --> 00:18:10.887
cells are not building
what you would like them to build.

00:18:10.911 --> 00:18:14.367
And so if we understood
how to communicate with these collectives

00:18:14.391 --> 00:18:18.958
and really rewrite
their target morphologies,

00:18:18.982 --> 00:18:21.174
we would be able to normalize tumors,

00:18:21.198 --> 00:18:23.167
we would be able to repair birth defects,

00:18:23.191 --> 00:18:25.775
induce regeneration of limbs
and other organs,

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:29.191
and these are things
we have already done in frog models.

00:18:29.215 --> 00:18:31.877
And so now the next really exciting step

00:18:31.901 --> 00:18:35.630
is to take this into mammalian cells

00:18:35.654 --> 00:18:39.140
and to really turn this into the next
generation of regenerative medicine

00:18:39.164 --> 00:18:43.685
where we learn to address
all of these biomedical needs

00:18:43.709 --> 00:18:45.789
by communicating with the cell collectives

00:18:45.813 --> 00:18:49.251
and rewriting their bioelectric
pattern memories.

00:18:49.275 --> 00:18:52.837
And the final thing I'd like to say
is that the importance of this field

00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:54.519
is not only for biomedicine.

00:18:54.543 --> 00:18:56.706
You see, this, as I started out by saying,

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.342
this ability of cells
in novel environments

00:18:59.366 --> 00:19:03.310
to build all kinds of things
besides what their genome tells them

00:19:03.334 --> 00:19:05.191
is an example of intelligence,

00:19:05.215 --> 00:19:07.872
and biology has been
intelligently solving problems

00:19:07.896 --> 00:19:09.824
long before brains came on the scene.

00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:14.697
And so this is also the beginnings
of a new inspiration for machine learning

00:19:14.721 --> 00:19:19.060
that mimics the artificial intelligence
of body cells, not just brains,

00:19:19.084 --> 00:19:22.304
for applications in computer intelligence.

00:19:24.566 --> 00:19:27.705
CA: Mike Levin, thank you
for your extraordinary work

00:19:27.729 --> 00:19:30.032
and for sharing it
so compellingly with us.

00:19:30.056 --> 00:19:31.207
Thank you.

00:19:31.231 --> 00:19:33.230
ML: Thank you so much. Thank you, Chris.
