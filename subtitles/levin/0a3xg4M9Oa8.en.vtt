00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.630
- People tend to think of intelligence

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.805
as being of two kinds:

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.310
There's the quote, unquote
"real" intelligence,

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.290
which is what we are supposed to have,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.390
and then there's this idea of
a 'collective intelligence,'

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.790
so swarms of bees, colonies of ants,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.530
shoals of fish, and so on.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.670
And people tend to think of those

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.320
as radically different things.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.417
But the reality is

00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:25.565
all intelligence is
collective intelligence,

00:00:25.565 --> 00:00:28.530
and this is because we
are all made of parts.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.810
So you and I are collections of cells,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.643
and these cells,

00:00:31.643 --> 00:00:33.720
including neurons and various
other cells in our body,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.040
have many competencies-

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.900
this is because they were once

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.090
separate individuals by themselves.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.650
They were unicellular organisms

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.740
with all of the skills needed
to survive in a complex world.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.180
And that journey that we all took,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.150
those progressive steps by
which we construct ourselves-

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.978
we construct our bodies,
we construct our minds-

00:00:49.978 --> 00:00:53.010
that journey is maybe the
most profound question

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.913
in all of science.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.240
I'm Michael Levin, and I'm
a developmental biologist

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.349
at Tufts University.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.320
Developmental biology is
maybe the most magical

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.160
of all the sciences

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.290
because you get to see with your own eyes

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.263
that journey that we all
take from physics to mind.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.160
We all start out life as
an unfertilized oocyte,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.320
and then slowly, gradually, step-by-step,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.369
that oocyte turns into a bunch of cells

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.640
that self-construct an embryo,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.230
and eventually that embryo matures

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.120
and becomes a large-scale adult.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.923
In the case of a human,
it will be an individual

00:01:31.923 --> 00:01:35.250
with metacognitive capacities
and the ability to reason.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.949
But we all have our origin
in that chemistry and physics

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:39.780
of that initial oocyte.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.785
And the magic of developmental biology

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:44.070
is that there is a mechanism

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.870
by which all of these cells get together,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.520
and they are able to cooperate
towards large-scale goals.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.231
This is the notion that biology uses

00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:55.620
what I call a "Multi-scale
competency architecture,"

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.580
which basically means

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.430
that we are not simply nested structurally

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.590
in terms of cells which comprise tissues,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.180
comprising organs, and bodies,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.460
and then ultimately societies and so on-

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.650
that's obviously true
on a structural level.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.110
But more interesting is the
fact that each of these layers

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.480
has certain problem-solving competencies.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.850
Each one solves problems
in their own space,

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.280
so cells are simultaneously
solving problems

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.010
in physiological spaces
and metabolic spaces

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.020
and gene expression spaces,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.582
and tissues and organs are
solving those problems.

00:02:24.582 --> 00:02:28.020
But, for example, during
embryogenesis or regeneration,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.554
they're also solving
problems in anatomical space.

00:02:30.554 --> 00:02:32.670
They're trying to navigate a path

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.580
from the shape of an early
embryo or a fertilized zygote

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.770
all the way up to the
complexity of a human body

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.260
with all of the different
types of organs and structures.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.020
So the competency architecture
refers to the fact

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.847
that all of the parts inside of us

00:02:44.847 --> 00:02:47.040
and inside of all other creatures

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.230
are themselves competent agents

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.970
with preferences, with goals,

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.061
with various abilities
to pursue those goals,

00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:56.043
and other types of
problem-solving capacities.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.970
What evolution has given us is
this remarkable architecture

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.520
where every level shapes

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.950
the behavioral landscape
of the levels below-

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.500
and the levels below do
clever and interesting things

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.978
that allow the levels above
not to have to micromanage,

00:03:09.978 --> 00:03:11.250
and to be able to control

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.443
in an interesting top-down capacity.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.580
One of the most important things

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.130
about this emerging field
of diverse intelligence

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.480
is that we, as humans,
have very limited capacity

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.763
and finely-honed ability
to see intelligence

00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:29.970
in medium-sized objects
moving at medium speeds

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.410
through three-dimensional space.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.850
So we see other primates

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.324
and we see crows and we see dolphins,

00:03:34.324 --> 00:03:36.574
and we have some ability
to recognize intelligence.

00:03:36.574 --> 00:03:40.316
But we really are very bad
at recognizing intelligence

00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:42.900
in unconventional embodiments

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.020
where our basic expectations
strain against this idea

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.853
that there could be intelligence

00:03:46.853 --> 00:03:50.670
in something extremely
small or extremely large.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.287
People often criticize
this approach by saying,

00:03:53.287 --> 00:03:54.720
"Well, then anything goes.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.850
If you can pick up a rock and say,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.960
'I think this rock is
cognitive and intelligent,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.280
you know, there's a spirit with hopes

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.570
and dreams inside of every rock.'"

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.650
That's not what this is.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.300
This is quite different.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.740
As an engineer, what you have to do

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.390
is you have to come up with a way

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.460
to look at a particular system

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.556
that doesn't overestimate its intelligence

00:04:10.556 --> 00:04:12.625
or underestimate its intelligence.

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:15.690
If you treat complex animals
as if they were clockwork,

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.610
you're gonna miss everything
that's important and exciting

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.660
about how they work.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.630
If you treat a clock as if it
had a complex intelligence,

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.160
you're going to waste a lot of time-

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.370
but getting it right is
fundamentally important.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.470
And so, you have this
spectrum where the engineer

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.710
has to pick the right
level for the right system,

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.127
and it's critical not to then say,

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:35.280
"Well, that doesn't sound like
human intelligence," right?

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.410
We're looking for the
basic minimal version.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.210
So I think it should have two things:

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.080
The first thing it should have

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.660
is some degree of goal-directedness,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.520
some ability to take different paths

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.560
to get to the same goals;

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.300
so this is William James's
definition of intelligence.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.775
And it has to have some
ability to undertake actions

00:04:51.775 --> 00:04:54.717
that are not completely
determined by local circumstances.

00:04:54.717 --> 00:04:56.082
So you start with all of that,

00:04:56.082 --> 00:04:58.260
and systems that have scaled up,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.830
those basic, very fundamental,
non-zero levels of agency,

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.815
we call that life.

00:05:02.815 --> 00:05:05.760
So it is a spectrum, and I
think that in this Universe

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.460
it goes all the way to the bottom.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.390
It's very hard for people

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.995
to think about these unconventional
kinds of intelligences

00:05:15.995 --> 00:05:18.660
that may be either too large or too small.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.630
And of course, they often
work in other spaces.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.280
So we're good with
three-dimensional space,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.620
but imagine if we had a primary sense

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.003
of our own blood chemistry.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.790
If you could feel your blood chemistry

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.010
the way that you currently
see and smell and taste

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.360
things that are around you,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.430
I think we would have
absolutely no problem

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.750
having an intuitive understanding

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.460
of physiological-state space

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.290
the way we do for three-dimensional space.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.864
I think that we would
immediately be able to recognize

00:05:42.864 --> 00:05:46.260
our various internal organs
as intelligent agents

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.050
navigating that space and
solving these kind of problems,

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.090
all the various things
that happen during the day.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.237
And here's one of my favorite
examples of problem solving

00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:56.748
in physiological and
transcriptional spaces:

00:05:56.748 --> 00:05:57.990
So we have these worms.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.910
These are Planaria, these are flatworms.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.630
And if you put these flatworms
in a solution of barium-

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.270
barium is a non-specific
potassium channel blocker;

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.680
it blocks the ability of these cells

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.170
to exchange potassium
with the outside world-

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.650
the cells really don't like it,

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.545
especially cells in the head,

00:06:11.545 --> 00:06:13.260
because the head is full of neurons;

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.940
neurons love to pass potassium.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.000
And so what happens is that
overnight their heads explode.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.245
Literally, it's called head deprogression;

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.185
they literally lose their heads.

00:06:21.185 --> 00:06:23.430
But if you leave them in the barium,

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.040
within a couple weeks
they grow back a new head.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.990
And the new head is
completely barium-adapted,

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.030
has no problem with the barium whatsoever.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.863
We said, "How could this be?"

00:06:30.863 --> 00:06:33.660
We looked at the original
heads, the original naive heads,

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.820
we looked at the barium-adapted heads,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.017
and we simply did a subtraction and asked,

00:06:38.017 --> 00:06:40.110
"What are the different genes
that are expressed here?"

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.820
And we found out that
the barium-adapted heads

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.614
have just a small number of genes

00:06:43.614 --> 00:06:45.630
that were turned on and off

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.810
to allow them to adapt
to this novel stressor.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.100
Now, here's the amazing part.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.470
Planaria never see barium in the wild.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.910
There's no evolutionary history

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.800
of knowing what to do when
you're hit with barium.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.300
This is not an ecological stressor

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.920
that they normally have to deal with.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.960
So just imagine you're a bunch of cells

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.000
and you're hit with this
incredible physiological stressor

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.200
you've never seen before.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.048
You've got tens of thousands of genes.

00:07:06.048 --> 00:07:07.140
What do you do?

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.330
How do you know which
genes to turn on and off?

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.769
You don't have time to try combinations.

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:12.810
You don't have time for
an exhaustive search.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.836
You don't have time for hill climbing.

00:07:13.836 --> 00:07:15.750
You don't have time to try random things

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.721
because you'll probably kill the cell

00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:18.848
long before you solve the problem.

00:07:18.848 --> 00:07:20.910
And yet, you are able to navigate

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.370
from where you are to where you need to be

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.680
to escape this physiological stressor.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.870
And so, what I think evolution has done

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.760
is pivoted some of the same tricks

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.750
from very simple systems that
only solve metabolic problems

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.222
eventually to physiological

00:07:35.222 --> 00:07:37.530
and then to transcriptional problems.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.809
And when multicellularity
comes on the scene,

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:42.237
large-scale anatomical problems.

00:07:42.237 --> 00:07:44.065
And so it's never a question of:

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:47.850
Is something physics and
chemistry, or is it cognitive?

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.892
The question is: What kind
of cognition, and how much?
