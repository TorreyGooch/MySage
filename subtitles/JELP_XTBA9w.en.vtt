you were perfect at that would you be
 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.189 align:start position:0%
you were perfect at that would you be

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
eradicate all suffering because you
 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.029 align:start position:0%
eradicate all suffering because you
could<00:00:29.119><c> even</c><00:00:29.400><c> ask</c><00:00:29.679><c> well</c><00:00:30.039><c> if</c><00:00:30.160><c> we</c><00:00:30.279><c> all</c><00:00:30.560><c> played</c>

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 align:start position:0%
could even ask well if we all played
 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.549 align:start position:0%
could even ask well if we all played
optimally<00:00:31.720><c> so</c><00:00:31.920><c> we</c><00:00:32.040><c> all</c><00:00:32.320><c> revealed</c><00:00:33.079><c> that</c><00:00:33.399><c> which</c>

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 align:start position:0%
optimally so we all revealed that which
 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.470 align:start position:0%
optimally so we all revealed that which
was<00:00:33.840><c> hidden</c><00:00:34.160><c> within</c><00:00:34.440><c> us</c><00:00:34.680><c> in</c><00:00:34.840><c> that</c><00:00:35.040><c> Spirit</c><00:00:35.320><c> of</c>

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
was hidden within us in that Spirit of
 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.670 align:start position:0%
was hidden within us in that Spirit of
play<00:00:36.440><c> how</c><00:00:36.640><c> good</c><00:00:36.800><c> would</c><00:00:37.000><c> the</c><00:00:37.120><c> world</c><00:00:37.520><c> be</c><00:00:38.520><c> and</c>

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
play how good would the world be and
 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.670 align:start position:0%
play how good would the world be and
that's<00:00:38.960><c> also</c><00:00:39.200><c> an</c><00:00:39.399><c> open</c><00:00:39.760><c> question</c><00:00:40.399><c> cuz</c><00:00:40.559><c> you</c>

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's also an open question cuz you
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.709 align:start position:0%
that's also an open question cuz you
know<00:00:40.840><c> it</c><00:00:40.960><c> would</c><00:00:41.079><c> be</c><00:00:41.239><c> a</c><00:00:41.320><c> lot</c><00:00:41.559><c> better</c><00:00:41.840><c> than</c><00:00:41.960><c> it</c><00:00:42.160><c> is</c>

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
know it would be a lot better than it is
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.910 align:start position:0%
know it would be a lot better than it is
right<00:00:43.000><c> and</c><00:00:43.120><c> then</c><00:00:43.840><c> what's</c><00:00:44.079><c> the</c><00:00:44.200><c> upper</c><00:00:44.440><c> limit</c><00:00:44.719><c> to</c>

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
right and then what's the upper limit to
 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
right and then what's the upper limit to
that<00:00:45.160><c> and</c><00:00:45.520><c> I</c><00:00:45.600><c> don't</c><00:00:45.840><c> think</c><00:00:46.079><c> we</c><00:00:46.280><c> know</c>
