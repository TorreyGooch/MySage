### Work Order for Component 2: Subtitle Downloader

**Objective**:  
Develop a script that downloads subtitles for YouTube videos listed in a text file. These subtitles will be used for transcription and further processing in subsequent stages of the project.

**Input**:  
- A text file (`urls.txt`) containing one YouTube video URL per line, generated by the URL Generator.

**Output**:  
- Subtitle files in the `.srt` format stored locally, named according to the video ID.

**Requirements**:
1. Use the `yt-dlp` library to download subtitles.
2. The script should:
   - Read the list of video URLs from `urls.txt`.
   - Download subtitles for each video in the list.
   - Handle cases where subtitles are not available for a video. (in this case, save the video URL to a separate file)
   - Save each subtitle file in the `.srt` format, named using the video ID (e.g., `example2.srt`).

**Technical Specifications**:
1. The script should be written in **Python**.
2. Use the `yt-dlp` library to download subtitles.
3. Include error handling for network issues or unavailable subtitles.
4. Ensure the script can handle a large number of URLs efficiently.

**Deliverables**:
1. A Python script (`subtitle_downloader.py`) that:
   - Accepts a text file (`urls.txt`) as input.
   - Outputs subtitle files in the `.srt` format for each video URL.
